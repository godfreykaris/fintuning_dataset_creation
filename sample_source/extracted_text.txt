Sometimes my questions are going to be very
foreseeable, you'll know what I'm going to be asking,
but I do ask that you wait until I get done. Because
we have a court repQpm@emrtrereyt and he's taking down
everything I say, everything you say and it's just a
lot easier if only one of us is talking at a time.
A. Okay.
Q. And the other thing would be if the answer is
yes or no and you nod, I probably know what you mean,
but he's going to do a transcript of what we say here
today, and it just,might-=not be clear :threegmontalse+
from now. So answer out loud yes or ano. And like

Q. And when you said we, would you -- you have
to do whatever comes up?
A. Yeah.
Q. What's involved in the basic clean up of,
say, an oil spill? When I say what's involved, I
mean what would your duties be, what do you have to
do?
A. My duties would be to contain the oil spill,
just throw down a boom which is --
you're talking about a spill on the water,
could be on the water or on land. Like we
had one at a gas station where all we had to do was
throw padding down and pick up the padding and just
pressure wash it down, and that was it, we were done.
Q. How about if it's on the water or on a river?
A. Well, if it's on the water, we'll go ina
boat -- if it requires a boat, and we'll throw the
Sausage boom down.
Q. Okay. Then does the sausage boom absorb the
oil or does it just contain it?
(410) 268-6006 - 1-866-337-6778

A, It pulls up the oil, leaves the water behind,
lets the water go through it.
Q. And what do you do then with the sausage boom
then?
A. The sausage boom gets pulled in.
QO. And how's that done?
A. With -- they look like broomsticks with hooks
on it.
Q. But you have to manually do that or is it
winched in? I'm just wondering what your duties are.
A. They'll pull it in. Like our boat has the
winch, and just unhook it as pulls in.
Q. Okay. I'm really kind of looking to explore
what the physical nature of your job is. Do you
consider it a physical job or moderate or light duty?
A. No, it's light.
Q. Light duty?
A. It's light.
Q. When you say you have to -- sometimes you
have to throw down the padding, how much does the
padding way?

Q. So you're just sopping it up?
A. Yeah.
Q. So you don't -- it's not like big rolls of
this that you're dealing with?

16-by-16.
Q. When you pick them up, where do you put them?
A. In trash bags or in drums.
Do you have to carry the trash bags?
Not me.
Q. Not you?
A. No, because when I got hired I was told -- I
toid them about my limitations, so they work with me
on that.
Q. What's the most you have to lift as far as

Sometimes my questions are going to be very
foreseeable, you'll know what I'm going to be asking,
but I do ask that you wait until I get done. Because
we have a court repQpm@emrtrereyt and he's taking down

lot easier if only one of us is talking at a time.
A. Okay.
Q. And the other thing would be if the answer is
yes or no and you nod, I probably know what you mean,

Q. And when you said we, would you -- you have
to do whatever comes up?
A. Yeah.
Q. What's involved in the basic clean up of,
say, an oil spill? When I say what's involved, I
mean what would your duties be, what do you have to
do?
A. My duties would be to contain the oil spill,
just throw down a boom which is --
you're talking about a spill on the water,
could be on the water or on land. Like we
had one at a gas station where all we had to do was
throw padding down and pick up the padding and just
pressure wash it down, and that was it, we were done.
Q. How about if it's on the water or on a river?
A. Well, if it's on the water, we'll go ina
boat -- if it requires a boat, and we'll throw the
Sausage boom down.
Q. Okay. Then does the sausage boom absorb the
oil or does it just contain it?
(410) 268-6006 - 1-866-337-6778

A, It pulls up the oil, leaves the water behind,
lets the water go through it.
Q. And what do you do then with the sausage boom
then?
A. The sausage boom gets pulled in.
QO. And how's that done?
A. With -- they look like broomsticks with hooks
on it.
Q. But you have to manually do that or is it
winched in? I'm just wondering what your duties are.
A. They'll pull it in. Like our boat has the
winch, and just unhook it as pulls in.
Q. Okay. I'm really kind of looking to explore
what the physical nature of your job is. Do you
consider it a physical job or moderate or light duty?
A. No, it's light.
Q. Light duty?
A. It's light.
Q. When you say you have to -- sometimes you
have to throw down the padding, how much does the
padding way?

this that you're dealing with?

Do you have to carry the trash bags?

foreseeable, you'll know what I'm going to be asking,
but I do ask that you wait until I get done. Because

Q. And when you said we, would you -- you have
to do whatever comes up?
A. Yeah.
Q. What's involved in the basic clean up of,
say, an oil spill? When I say what's involved, I
mean what would your duties be, what do you have to
do?
A. My duties would be to contain the oil spill,
just throw down a boom which is --
you're talking about a spill on the water,
could be on the water or on land. Like we
had one at a gas station where all we had to do was
throw padding down and pick up the padding and just
pressure wash it down, and that was it, we were done.
Q. How about if it's on the water or on a river?
A. Well, if it's on the water, we'll go ina
boat -- if it requires a boat, and we'll throw the
Sausage boom down.
Q. Okay. Then does the sausage boom absorb the
oil or does it just contain it?
(410) 268-6006 - 1-866-337-6778

A, It pulls up the oil, leaves the water behind,
lets the water go through it.
Q. And what do you do then with the sausage boom
then?
A. The sausage boom gets pulled in.
QO. And how's that done?
A. With -- they look like broomsticks with hooks
on it.
Q. But you have to manually do that or is it
winched in? I'm just wondering what your duties are.
A. They'll pull it in. Like our boat has the
winch, and just unhook it as pulls in.
Q. Okay. I'm really kind of looking to explore
what the physical nature of your job is. Do you
consider it a physical job or moderate or light duty?
A. No, it's light.
Q. Light duty?
A. It's light.
Q. When you say you have to -- sometimes you
have to throw down the padding, how much does the
padding way?

yes or no and you nod, I probably know what you mean,
but he's going to do a transcript of what we say here

Q. And when you said we, would you -- you have
to do whatever comes up?
A. Yeah.
Q. What's involved in the basic clean up of,
say, an oil spill? When I say what's involved, I
mean what would your duties be, what do you have to
do?
A. My duties would be to contain the oil spill,
just throw down a boom which is --
you're talking about a spill on the water,
could be on the water or on land. Like we
had one at a gas station where all we had to do was
throw padding down and pick up the padding and just
pressure wash it down, and that was it, we were done.
Q. How about if it's on the water or on a river?
A. Well, if it's on the water, we'll go ina
boat -- if it requires a boat, and we'll throw the
Sausage boom down.
Q. Okay. Then does the sausage boom absorb the
oil or does it just contain it?
(410) 268-6006 - 1-866-337-6778

A, It pulls up the oil, leaves the water behind,
lets the water go through it.
Q. And what do you do then with the sausage boom
then?
A. The sausage boom gets pulled in.
QO. And how's that done?
A. With -- they look like broomsticks with hooks
on it.
Q. But you have to manually do that or is it
winched in? I'm just wondering what your duties are.
A. They'll pull it in. Like our boat has the
winch, and just unhook it as pulls in.
Q. Okay. I'm really kind of looking to explore
what the physical nature of your job is. Do you
consider it a physical job or moderate or light duty?
A. No, it's light.
Q. Light duty?
A. It's light.
Q. When you say you have to -- sometimes you
have to throw down the padding, how much does the
padding way?

16-by-16.
Q. When you pick them up, where do you put them?
A. In trash bags or in drums.
Do you have to carry the trash bags?
Not me.

toid them about my limitations, so they work with me
on that.

Q. And when you said we, would you -- you have
to do whatever comes up?
A. Yeah.
Q. What's involved in the basic clean up of,
say, an oil spill? When I say what's involved, I
mean what would your duties be, what do you have to
do?
A. My duties would be to contain the oil spill,
just throw down a boom which is --
you're talking about a spill on the water,
could be on the water or on land. Like we
had one at a gas station where all we had to do was
throw padding down and pick up the padding and just
pressure wash it down, and that was it, we were done.
Q. How about if it's on the water or on a river?
A. Well, if it's on the water, we'll go ina
boat -- if it requires a boat, and we'll throw the
Sausage boom down.
Q. Okay. Then does the sausage boom absorb the
oil or does it just contain it?

A, It pulls up the oil, leaves the water behind,
lets the water go through it.
Q. And what do you do then with the sausage boom
then?
A. The sausage boom gets pulled in.
QO. And how's that done?
A. With -- they look like broomsticks with hooks
on it.
Q. But you have to manually do that or is it
winched in? I'm just wondering what your duties are.
A. They'll pull it in. Like our boat has the
winch, and just unhook it as pulls in.
Q. Okay. I'm really kind of looking to explore
what the physical nature of your job is. Do you
consider it a physical job or moderate or light duty?
A. No, it's light.
Q. Light duty?
A. It's light.
Q. When you say you have to -- sometimes you
have to throw down the padding, how much does the
padding way?

A. Yeah.
Q. So you don't -- it's not like big rolls of
this that you're dealing with?

16-by-16.
Q. When you pick them up, where do you put them?
A. In trash bags or in drums.
Do you have to carry the trash bags?
Not me.
Q. Not you?

toid them about my limitations, so they work with me
on that.
