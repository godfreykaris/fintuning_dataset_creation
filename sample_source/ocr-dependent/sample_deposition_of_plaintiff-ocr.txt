Line 156, 16:02:23: A. My duties would be to contain the oil spill,
Line 157, 16:02:23: just throw down a boom which is --
Line 158, 16:02:23: you're talking about a spill on the water,
Line 159, 16:02:23: could be on the water or on land. Like we
Line 160, 16:02:23: had one at a gas station where all we had to do was
Line 161, 16:02:23: throw padding down and pick up the padding and just
Line 162, 16:02:23: pressure wash it down, and that was it, we were done.
Line 163, 16:02:23: Q. How about if it's on the water or on a river?
Line 164, 16:02:23: A. Well, if it's on the water, we'll go ina
Line 165, 16:02:23: boat -- if it requires a boat, and we'll throw the
Line 166, 16:02:23: Sausage boom down.
Line 167, 16:02:23: Q. Okay. Then does the sausage boom absorb the
Line 168, 16:02:23: oil or does it just contain it?

Line 173, 16:02:31: A, It pulls up the oil, leaves the water behind,
Line 174, 16:02:31: lets the water go through it.
Line 175, 16:02:31: Q. And what do you do then with the sausage boom
Line 176, 16:02:31: then?
Line 177, 16:02:31: A. The sausage boom gets pulled in.
Line 178, 16:02:31: QO. And how's that done?
Line 179, 16:02:31: A. With -- they look like broomsticks with hooks
Line 180, 16:02:31: on it.
Line 181, 16:02:31: Q. But you have to manually do that or is it
Line 182, 16:02:31: winched in? I'm just wondering what your duties are.
Line 183, 16:02:31: A. They'll pull it in. Like our boat has the
Line 184, 16:02:31: winch, and just unhook it as pulls in.
Line 185, 16:02:31: Q. Okay. I'm really kind of looking to explore
Line 186, 16:02:31: what the physical nature of your job is. Do you
Line 187, 16:02:31: consider it a physical job or moderate or light duty?
Line 188, 16:02:31: A. No, it's light.
Line 189, 16:02:31: Q. Light duty?
Line 190, 16:02:31: A. It's light.
Line 191, 16:02:31: Q. When you say you have to -- sometimes you
Line 192, 16:02:31: have to throw down the padding, how much does the
Line 193, 16:02:31: padding way?

Line 206, 16:02:31: this that you're dealing with?
Line 207, 16:02:31: A. No, they're just cut out pads probably
Line 208, 16:02:31: 16-by-16.
Line 209, 16:02:31: Q. When you pick them up, where do you put them?
Line 210, 16:02:31: A. In trash bags or in drums.
Line 211, 16:02:31: Do you have to carry the trash bags?
Line 212, 16:02:31: Not me.
Line 213, 16:02:31: Q. Not you?
Line 214, 16:02:31: A. No, because when I got hired I was told -- I
Line 215, 16:02:31: toid them about my limitations, so they work with me
Line 216, 16:02:31: on that.

Line 281, 16:02:35: at the bottom and then another two about halfway up,
Line 282, 16:02:35: and you just push it or pull and it’s light.

Line 288, 16:02:35: A. But if there's no drum carts I won't touch
Line 289, 16:02:35: Q. Okay. How do they typically if there's not a
Line 290, 16:02:35: drum cart move the barrels or the drums?
Line 291, 16:02:35: A. Well, they'll grab them with their left or
Line 292, 16:02:35: right hand, whatever, and they'll break it back and
Line 293, 16:02:35: roll it.
Line 294, 16:02:35: Q. Okay. I guess they're sealed at this point?

Line 312, 16:02:35: Okay. He liked being the owner?
Line 313, 16:02:35: Yeah, exactly.
Line 314, 16:02:35: You were the laborer?
Line 315, 16:02:35: I was the worker.
Line 316, 16:02:35: Q. I see. When did that shut down?
Line 317, 16:02:35: A. Like a month after the accident because I
Line 318, 16:02:35: couldn't go to work. We just let the lease run out,
Line 319, 16:02:35: turned it in.
Line 320, 16:02:35: Q. Had he been contemplating that at all before

Line 329, 16:02:35: shutting down the barber shox?

Line 331, 16:02:35: Q. How long did you work there?
Line 332, 16:02:35: A. I had it for almost two years. I was two
Line 333, 16:02:35: months off of two years+s !

Line 337, 16:02:35: have any training as a barber?
Line 338, 16:02:35: A. I went to barber school for about four months
Line 339, 16:02:35: and didn't agree with the teacher's way of teaching,
Line 340, 16:02:35: because I was already cutting hair before.
Line 341, 16:02:35: Q. Why don't I just run back through your
Line 342, 16:02:35: employment history, and then you can kind of explain
Line 343, 16:02:35: that to me. Before you were working in the barber
Line 344, 16:02:35: shop -- before I even get there, while you've been
Line 345, 16:02:35: working at que, have you been working

Line 375, 16:02:40: A. Yeah.
Line 376, 16:02:40: Q. All right. Before that you were at the
Line 377, 16:02:40: barber shop. Other than working at the barber shop,
Line 378, 16:02:40: did you have any other employment?
Line 379, 16:02:40: A. No. Well, my girlfriend -- I had given her
Line 380, 16:02:40: money, she opened up a grocery store. So I used to
Line 381, 16:02:40: go in and out of the grocery store, help her out. As
Line 382, 16:02:40: a matter of fact, the day of the accident, I was
Line 383, 16:02:40: working the grocery store because barber shops are
Line 384, 16:02:40: closed on Mondays.
Line 385, 16:02:40: QO. Okay. Was that a form of employment? Were
Line 386, 16:02:40: you getting paid at all for working there?
Line 387, 16:02:40: A. No.
Line 388, 16:02:40: Q. Does she still own that grocery store?
Line 389, 16:02:40: A. No, we closed it down because after the
Line 390, 16:02:40: accident -- well, we didn't close it down, we sold
Line 391, 16:02:40: it. After the accident, her grandpa came down with
Line 392, 16:02:40: Alzheimer's and she had gotten pregnant, so we had no
Line 393, 16:02:40: way of taking care of the store.
Line 394, 16:02:40: Q. Had the grandfather been working there too?
Line 395, 16:02:40: A. No, her grandmother had been helping her out

Line 401, 16:02:40: with the store. So she had to stay home because of
Line 402, 16:02:40: her grandpa.
Line 403, 16:02:40: Q. And then your girlfriend was pregnant so she
Line 404, 16:02:40: needed more time away so you sold the store?
Line 405, 16:02:40: Yeah,
Line 406, 16:02:40: But that wasn't related to this accident,
Line 407, 16:02:40: the selling of the store?
Line 408, 16:02:40: Somewhat.
Line 409, 16:02:40: Somewhat?
Line 410, 16:02:40: Because I couldn't help out as much as TI did.
Line 411, 16:02:40: Well --
Line 412, 16:02:40: If there was nobody at the store, I'd run the
Line 413, 16:02:40: barber shop and the store.
Line 414, 16:02:40: Q. Were they right next to each other?
Line 415, 16:02:40: Yeah.
Line 416, 16:02:40: And that would work I guess for as long as no
Line 417, 16:02:40: in the barber shop?
Line 418, 16:02:40: Uh-huh.
Line 419, 16:02:40: Were these operations run under corporate
Line 420, 16:02:40: names or under your individual names?

Line 464, 16:02:40: got started doing these hours? That was a horrible
Line 465, 16:02:40: question, excuse me. You mentioned that you worked
Line 466, 16:02:40: on Thursdays and Fridays from 12:00 to 8:00. Maybe

Line 481, 16:02:45: Q. How about the barber shop, did you continue
Line 482, 16:02:45: to work there after the accident?
Line 483, 16:02:45: A. I tried to. I tried to and it was just too
Line 484, 16:02:45: Much. And I even went to the extent of getting a
Line 485, 16:02:45: tall stool where I could sit down and cut, but the
Line 486, 16:02:45: dangling on my leg, I couldn't cut it.

Line 710, 16:02:53: thing --
Line 711, 16:02:53: A. I saw the lights and we hit. But when I saw

Line 722, 16:02:53: QO. Well, describe what her actions were. You

Line 1188, 16:03:16: 9 NI:
Line 1189, 16:03:16: 10 Q. When you had that slip and fall, was that
Line 1190, 16:03:16: because of some ongoing problem with the knee? Did
Line 1191, 16:03:16: that cause it to give way or give out?
Line 1192, 16:03:16: A. No.
Line 1193, 16:03:16: 14 Q. It was just a completely separate slip and
Line 1194, 16:03:16: 16 A. Yeah. I was on top of a piece of machinery
Line 1195, 16:03:16: changing a light bulb and I fell. Then my knee
Line 1196, 16:03:16: buckled and stuff when I fell,

Line 1206, 16:03:23: Your knee buckled. That was at a jobsite?
Line 1207, 16:03:23: A. No, that was in one of the warehouses.
Line 1208, 16:03:23: Q. All right. And then what treatment did you
Line 1209, 16:03:23: get for that knee after the slip and fall?
Line 1210, 16:03:23: A. I had an X-ray, MRI, and the doctor decided
Line 1211, 16:03:23: that I was going to need surgery.
Line 1212, 16:03:23: Q. Okay. Do you remember what surgery -- what
Line 1213, 16:03:23: type of surgery they did? First of all, did they do
Line 1214, 16:03:23: it open or did they do it arthroscopic?
Line 1215, 16:03:23: A. Open.
Line 1216, 16:03:23: Q. And do you remember what the procedure was,
Line 1217, 16:03:23: what they were trying to fix?
Line 1218, 16:03:23: A. They took a piece I think of the front of the
Line 1219, 16:03:23: patella tendon, took a piece of that and put it
Line 1220, 16:03:23: inside of the anterior cruciate ligament.
Line 1221, 16:03:23: Q. So kind of an anterior cruciate ligament

Line 1237, 16:03:23: Q. Well,
Line 1238, 16:03:23: before the accident. Did the surgery
Line 1239, 16:03:23: improve the condition?
Line 1240, 16:03:23: 10 A. It helped but it didn't -- it wasn't a full
Line 1241, 16:03:23: improvement. He had to go back in and tighten it up
Line 1242, 16:03:23: a little bit more arthroscopically.
Line 1243, 16:03:23: 13 Q. So there was a second surgery?
Line 1244, 16:03:23: 14 A. Yeah.
Line 1245, 16:03:23: 15 Q. After the arthroscopic surgery, did the

Line 1247, 16:03:23: A. Yeah.
Line 1248, 16:03:23: 18 Q. Did it return to its pre slip and fall
Line 1249, 16:03:23: condition?

Line 1587, 16:03:39: therapy or did the therapy just not help?
Line 1588, 16:03:39: 13 A. No, it wasn't doing much. Basically what the
Line 1589, 16:03:39: doctor said, that they were going to do the therapy
Line 1590, 16:03:39: to strengthen the knee for surgery. This way I'd
Line 1591, 16:03:39: have supposedly a quicker recovery.

Line 1616, 16:03:39: healed they put me in aquatic therapy.
Line 1617, 16:03:39: Q. When you say scarring, you mean the scabs
Line 1618, 16:03:39: from the surgery?
Line 1619, 16:03:39: A. Yeah. After all that healed up, they put me

Line 1633, 16:03:43: Q. About how often do you get pain?
Line 1634, 16:03:43: A. It depends on activity. I would say probably
Line 1635, 16:03:43: about four or five times a week. It depends how long
Line 1636, 16:03:43: I'm on it.
Line 1637, 16:03:43: Q. Okay. What type of activity causes the pain?
Line 1638, 16:03:43: A. Well, just being on it all day or walking.
Line 1639, 16:03:43: Like if I go to the mall or something, a couple hours
Line 1640, 16:03:43: of driving a stick shift vehicle.
Line 1641, 16:03:43: Q. Do you have a stick shift vehicle?
Line 1642, 16:03:43: A. Not anymore. My wife's -- my girlfriend's

Line 1644, 16:03:43: needs to use mine because mine has more space and
Line 1645, 16:03:43: I'll use his to go to work.

Line 1655, 16:03:43: You've mentioned being on it and then driving a stick
Line 1656, 16:03:43: shift can cause pain. Anything else that you do
Line 1657, 16:03:43: specifically that causes pain?
Line 1658, 16:03:43: A. I can't think of anything right now.
Line 1659, 16:03:43: Q. Okay. And I think the answers to
Line 1660, 16:03:43: interrogatories mentioned part of your job is
Line 1661, 16:03:43: shoveling?
Line 1662, 16:03:43: A. Yes.
Line 1663, 16:03:43: Q. When you're doing shoveling, does that cause
Line 1664, 16:03:43: problems with your knee either while you're working
Line 1665, 16:03:43: or later?
Line 1666, 16:03:43: A. What I do when I'm shoveling now is
Line 1667, 16:03:43: of using my right leg -- you know, when you
Line 1668, 16:03:43: you've got to kick the shovel in to be able
Line 1669, 16:03:43: the dirt out,
Line 1670, 16:03:43: Q. This is when you're digging like contaminated
Line 1671, 16:03:43: soil or something like that?
Line 1672, 16:03:43: A. Yeah. So what I do is kick with my left
Line 1673, 16:03:43: instead of kicking with my right.
Line 1674, 16:03:43: Q. So you rest on the right and you do the work

Line 1700, 16:03:43: apply that?

Line 1707, 16:03:43: once in a while. Sometimes in the morning I'll wake
Line 1708, 16:03:43: up and I'll have that pain, so I know I have to carry
Line 1709, 16:03:43: it with me.
Line 1710, 16:03:43: Q. Is there anything that your knee condition
Line 1711, 16:03:43: prevents you from doing today that you could do back
Line 1712, 16:03:43: before February of 2003?
Line 1713, 16:03:43: A. Well, I was running around riding a bike and
Line 1714, 16:03:43: stuff. I'm not doing that anymore. I might jump on
Line 1715, 16:03:43: a motorcycle every now and then, but I'm not pedaling
Line 1716, 16:03:43: a bike or anything anymore.
Line 1717, 16:03:43: Q. How often were you riding a bike back in
Line 1718, 16:03:43: February of 2003 before this occurred?
Line 1719, 16:03:43: A. I went out whenever my stepson wanted to go
Line 1720, 16:03:43: out probably about once a week.
Line 1721, 16:03:43: Q. Did you have your own bike?
Line 1722, 16:03:43: A. Yeah.
Line 1723, 16:03:43: Do you still have it?
Line 1724, 16:03:43: No.
Line 1725, 16:03:43: Q. And when would you ride with him?
Line 1726, 16:03:43: A. Probably on the weekend for about an hour or
Line 1727, 16:03:43: whatever.

Line 1733, 16:03:47: Q. Anything else that you can't do today -- I
Line 1734, 16:03:47: don't even remember if I asked that question, but I
Line 1735, 16:03:47: will now. Is that something you can't do today that
Line 1736, 16:03:47: you could do before?
Line 1737, 16:03:47: A. Ride a bike?
Line 1738, 16:03:47: Right.
Line 1739, 16:03:47: No, I can't do it now.
Line 1740, 16:03:47: Okay. And has a doctor told you not to do
Line 1741, 16:03:47: A. Not that I can't do it, just I don't want to
Line 1742, 16:03:47: do anything that might aggravate my knee. I probably
Line 1743, 16:03:47: can, but I don't want to do it because it's just the
Line 1744, 16:03:47: fear of getting hurt again I guess.
Line 1745, 16:03:47: Q. And when did you start riding a bike after
Line 1746, 16:03:47: your prior surgery in, say -- which was I guess
Line 1747, 16:03:47: November of 2000?
Line 1748, 16:03:47: A. Probably about a year, year and a half
Line 1749, 16:03:47: afterwards.
Line 1750, 16:03:47: Q. So then for -- you could ride a bike for
Line 1751, 16:03:47: about a year and a half?
Line 1752, 16:03:47: A. After.

Line 1764, 16:03:47: Q. So this is a bike you had even before the
Line 1765, 16:03:47: other accidents?
Line 1766, 16:03:47: A. Uh-huh,
Line 1767, 16:03:47: Q. And the other surgeries, okay. Anything else
Line 1768, 16:03:47: that you cannot do today which you could do in

Line 1789, 16:03:47: playing?
Line 1790, 16:03:47: A. Just like throwing around a baseball,
Line 1791, 16:03:47: probably jogging a little bit with the kids.
Line 1792, 16:03:47: Q. Well, could you throw around a baseball
Line 1793, 16:03:47: Huh?
