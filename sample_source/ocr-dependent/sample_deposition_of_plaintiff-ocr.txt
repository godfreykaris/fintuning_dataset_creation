Line 5, 18:57:46: to do whatever comes up?
Line 6, 18:57:46: A. Yeah.
Line 7, 18:57:46: Q. What's involved in the basic clean up of,

Line 9, 18:57:46: mean what would your duties be, what do you have to
Line 10, 18:57:46: do?
Line 11, 18:57:46: A. My duties would be to contain the oil spill,
Line 12, 18:57:46: just throw down a boom which is --
Line 13, 18:57:46: you're talking about a spill on the water,
Line 14, 18:57:46: could be on the water or on land. Like we
Line 15, 18:57:46: had one at a gas station where all we had to do was
Line 16, 18:57:46: throw padding down and pick up the padding and just
Line 17, 18:57:46: pressure wash it down, and that was it, we were done.
Line 18, 18:57:46: Q. How about if it's on the water or on a river?
Line 19, 18:57:46: A. Well, if it's on the water, we'll go ina
Line 20, 18:57:46: boat -- if it requires a boat, and we'll throw the
Line 21, 18:57:46: Sausage boom down.
Line 22, 18:57:46: Q. Okay. Then does the sausage boom absorb the
Line 23, 18:57:46: oil or does it just contain it?

Line 4, 18:57:50: A, It pulls up the oil, leaves the water behind,
Line 5, 18:57:50: lets the water go through it.
Line 6, 18:57:50: Q. And what do you do then with the sausage boom
Line 7, 18:57:50: then?
Line 8, 18:57:50: A. The sausage boom gets pulled in.
Line 9, 18:57:50: QO. And how's that done?
Line 10, 18:57:50: A. With -- they look like broomsticks with hooks
Line 11, 18:57:50: on it.
Line 12, 18:57:50: Q. But you have to manually do that or is it
Line 13, 18:57:50: winched in? I'm just wondering what your duties are.
Line 14, 18:57:50: A. They'll pull it in. Like our boat has the
Line 15, 18:57:50: winch, and just unhook it as pulls in.
Line 16, 18:57:50: Q. Okay. I'm really kind of looking to explore
Line 17, 18:57:50: what the physical nature of your job is. Do you
Line 18, 18:57:50: consider it a physical job or moderate or light duty?
Line 19, 18:57:50: A. No, it's light.
Line 20, 18:57:50: Q. Light duty?
Line 21, 18:57:50: A. It's light.
Line 22, 18:57:50: Q. When you say you have to -- sometimes you
Line 23, 18:57:50: have to throw down the padding, how much does the
Line 24, 18:57:50: padding way?

Line 7, 18:57:50: towel.
Line 8, 18:57:50: Q. So you're just sopping it up?
Line 9, 18:57:50: A. Yeah.
Line 10, 18:57:50: Q. So you don't -- it's not like big rolls of
Line 11, 18:57:50: this that you're dealing with?
Line 12, 18:57:50: A. No, they're just cut out pads probably
Line 13, 18:57:50: 16-by-16.
Line 14, 18:57:50: Q. When you pick them up, where do you put them?
Line 15, 18:57:50: A. In trash bags or in drums.
Line 16, 18:57:50: Do you have to carry the trash bags?
Line 17, 18:57:50: Not me.
Line 18, 18:57:50: Q. Not you?
Line 19, 18:57:50: A. No, because when I got hired I was told -- I
Line 20, 18:57:50: toid them about my limitations, so they work with me
Line 21, 18:57:50: on that.
Line 22, 18:57:50: Q. What's the most you have to lift as far as

Line 9, 18:57:50: He's just the head man in charge.
Line 10, 18:57:50: Is he the one who actually hired you?
Line 11, 18:57:50: A. Yeah, he did the hiring.

Line 4, 18:57:54: filled drums, I won't touch them unless there's a
Line 5, 18:57:54: drum cart. Sometimes there's no drum carts. With a
Line 6, 18:57:54: drum cart you can just --
Line 7, 18:57:54: Q. It's on wheels?
Line 8, 18:57:54: A. Yeah, it's on wheels. It has two wheels down
Line 9, 18:57:54: at the bottom and then another two about halfway up,
Line 10, 18:57:54: and you just push it or pull and it’s light.
Line 11, 18:57:54: Q. When you say push -- you showed me, you kind
Line 12, 18:57:54: of tilted it over?
Line 13, 18:57:54: A. You tilt it down and it's laying on the other

Line 15, 18:57:54: Q. All right.
Line 16, 18:57:54: A. But if there's no drum carts I won't touch
Line 17, 18:57:54: Q. Okay. How do they typically if there's not a
Line 18, 18:57:54: drum cart move the barrels or the drums?
Line 19, 18:57:54: A. Well, they'll grab them with their left or
Line 20, 18:57:54: right hand, whatever, and they'll break it back and
Line 21, 18:57:54: roll it.
Line 22, 18:57:54: Q. Okay. I guess they're sealed at this point?

Line 22, 18:57:54: turned it in.
Line 23, 18:57:54: Q. Had he been contemplating that at all before

Line 15, 18:57:54: A. I went to barber school for about four months
Line 16, 18:57:54: and didn't agree with the teacher's way of teaching,
Line 17, 18:57:54: because I was already cutting hair before.
Line 18, 18:57:54: Q. Why don't I just run back through your
Line 19, 18:57:54: employment history, and then you can kind of explain
Line 20, 18:57:54: that to me. Before you were working in the barber
Line 21, 18:57:54: shop -- before I even get there, while you've been

Line 3, 18:57:58: A. Yeah.
Line 4, 18:57:58: Q. All right. Before that you were at the
Line 5, 18:57:58: barber shop. Other than working at the barber shop,
Line 6, 18:57:58: did you have any other employment?
Line 7, 18:57:58: A. No. Well, my girlfriend -- I had given her
Line 8, 18:57:58: money, she opened up a grocery store. So I used to
Line 9, 18:57:58: go in and out of the grocery store, help her out. As
Line 10, 18:57:58: a matter of fact, the day of the accident, I was
Line 11, 18:57:58: working the grocery store because barber shops are
Line 12, 18:57:58: closed on Mondays.
Line 13, 18:57:58: QO. Okay. Was that a form of employment? Were
Line 14, 18:57:58: you getting paid at all for working there?
Line 15, 18:57:58: A. No.
Line 16, 18:57:58: Q. Does she still own that grocery store?
Line 17, 18:57:58: A. No, we closed it down because after the
Line 18, 18:57:58: accident -- well, we didn't close it down, we sold
Line 19, 18:57:58: it. After the accident, her grandpa came down with
Line 20, 18:57:58: Alzheimer's and she had gotten pregnant, so we had no
Line 21, 18:57:58: way of taking care of the store.
Line 22, 18:57:58: Q. Had the grandfather been working there too?
Line 23, 18:57:58: A. No, her grandmother had been helping her out

Line 4, 18:57:58: with the store. So she had to stay home because of
Line 5, 18:57:58: her grandpa.
Line 6, 18:57:58: Q. And then your girlfriend was pregnant so she
Line 7, 18:57:58: needed more time away so you sold the store?
Line 8, 18:57:58: Yeah,
Line 9, 18:57:58: But that wasn't related to this accident,
Line 10, 18:57:58: the selling of the store?
Line 11, 18:57:58: Somewhat.
Line 12, 18:57:58: Somewhat?
Line 13, 18:57:58: Because I couldn't help out as much as TI did.
Line 14, 18:57:58: Well --
Line 15, 18:57:58: If there was nobody at the store, I'd run the
Line 16, 18:57:58: barber shop and the store.
Line 17, 18:57:58: Q. Were they right next to each other?
Line 18, 18:57:58: Yeah.
Line 19, 18:57:58: And that would work I guess for as long as no
Line 20, 18:57:58: in the barber shop?
Line 21, 18:57:58: Uh-huh.
Line 22, 18:57:58: Were these operations run under corporate
Line 23, 18:57:58: names or under your individual names?

Line 10, 18:58:02: Much. And I even went to the extent of getting a
Line 11, 18:58:02: tall stool where I could sit down and cut, but the
Line 12, 18:58:02: dangling on my leg, I couldn't cut it.

Line 15, 18:58:10: which was approaching you?
Line 16, 18:58:10: A. Well, when I saw her, it was a blink of an
Line 17, 18:58:10: eye thing. We just smashed.
Line 18, 18:58:10: Q. When you say it was a blink of an eye
Line 19, 18:58:10: thing --
Line 20, 18:58:10: A. I saw the lights and we hit. But when I saw
Line 21, 18:58:10: the lights, I grabbed onto the steering wheel as

Line 6, 18:58:10: another car coming behind her or something.
Line 7, 18:58:10: QO. Well, describe what her actions were. You
Line 8, 18:58:10: said you saw her coming towards you. Tell me, were

Line 19, 18:58:10: estimate her speed or see her beforehand?
Line 20, 18:58:10: A. No, I just seen the lights coming towards me.
Line 21, 18:58:10: QO. You didn't see her -- well, did you see her

Line 9, 18:58:30: A. I had an X-ray, MRI, and the doctor decided
Line 10, 18:58:30: that I was going to need surgery.
Line 11, 18:58:30: Q. Okay. Do you remember what surgery -- what
Line 12, 18:58:30: type of surgery they did? First of all, did they do
Line 13, 18:58:30: it open or did they do it arthroscopic?
Line 14, 18:58:30: A. Open.
Line 15, 18:58:30: Q. And do you remember what the procedure was,
Line 16, 18:58:30: what they were trying to fix?
Line 17, 18:58:30: A. They took a piece I think of the front of the
Line 18, 18:58:30: patella tendon, took a piece of that and put it
Line 19, 18:58:30: inside of the anterior cruciate ligament.
Line 20, 18:58:30: Q. So kind of an anterior cruciate ligament
Line 21, 18:58:30: reconstruction?
Line 22, 18:58:30: A. Yeah,
Line 23, 18:58:30: MS. ZOIS: I like to just call it ACL.

Line 13, 18:58:30: improve the condition?
Line 14, 18:58:30: 10 A. It helped but it didn't -- it wasn't a full
Line 15, 18:58:30: improvement. He had to go back in and tighten it up
Line 16, 18:58:30: a little bit more arthroscopically.
Line 17, 18:58:30: 13 Q. So there was a second surgery?
Line 18, 18:58:30: 14 A. Yeah.
Line 19, 18:58:30: 15 Q. After the arthroscopic surgery, did the
Line 20, 18:58:30: condition improve?
Line 21, 18:58:30: A. Yeah.
Line 22, 18:58:30: 18 Q. Did it return to its pre slip and fall
Line 23, 18:58:30: condition?
Line 24, 18:58:30: 20 A. Not 100 percent better, but I was able to
Line 25, 18:58:30: return to somewhat normal activities.

Line 3, 18:58:42: Page 62
Line 4, 18:58:42: 1 A. Because I had no insurance and he wouldn't
Line 5, 18:58:42: take care of me.
Line 6, 18:58:42: 3 Q. Well, did you ask him if that was the case?
Line 7, 18:58:42: 4 A. Yeah, I did. I spoke to him.
Line 8, 18:58:42: 5 Q. So you went and talked to -- you started
Line 9, 18:58:42: seeing Dr. Shepherd. What did Dr. Shepherd do for
Line 10, 18:58:42: you as far as therapy?
Line 11, 18:58:42: 8 A. He put me in the therapy program.
Line 12, 18:58:42: Q.
Line 13, 18:58:42: Was this for your knee?
Line 14, 18:58:42: A. Yeah.
Line 15, 18:58:42: 11 Q. Any other parts of your body?
Line 16, 18:58:42: 12 A. The first two weeks I was in therapy they put
Line 17, 18:58:42: 13 me like through -- I had a little bit of back pain,
Line 18, 18:58:42: electrical stimulation and heat pads.
Line 19, 18:58:42: 15 Q. Did the low back pain resolve within a couple
Line 20, 18:58:42: weeks or a month?

Line 4, 18:58:42: 1 Q. But the knee did continue to give you
Line 5, 18:58:42: problems?
Line 6, 18:58:42: A.
Line 7, 18:58:42: Yeah.
Line 8, 18:58:42: 4 Q. Did you continue to get physical therapy to
Line 9, 18:58:42: the knee for some time?
Line 10, 18:58:42: 6 A. Yeah, until right about a week before
Line 11, 18:58:42: surgery.
Line 12, 18:58:42: 8 Q@. I think the surgery was in May of 2003, does
Line 13, 18:58:42: that sound right?
Line 14, 18:58:42: 10 A. I think so,
Line 15, 18:58:42: 11 Q. The knee, was it improved at all with the
Line 16, 18:58:42: therapy or did the therapy just not help?
Line 17, 18:58:42: 13 A. No, it wasn't doing much. Basically what the
Line 18, 18:58:42: doctor said, that they were going to do the therapy
Line 19, 18:58:42: to strengthen the knee for surgery. This way I'd
Line 20, 18:58:42: have supposedly a quicker recovery.
Line 21, 18:58:42: Q. So you got a second opinion about the
Line 22, 18:58:42: Okay.
Line 23, 18:58:42: Surgery from Dr. O'Hearn? .
Line 24, 18:58:42: A. Dr. O'Hearn and Dr. Shepherd were Supposed to
Line 25, 18:58:42: be working together.

Line 4, 18:58:42: A. Well, it's separate offices. Yeah, he sent
Line 5, 18:58:42: me to Dr. O'Hearn to have him check it out also.
Line 6, 18:58:42: Q. Okay. But it was Dr. Shepherd who actually
Line 7, 18:58:42: sent you to Dr. O'Hearn?
Line 8, 18:58:42: A. Yeah.
Line 9, 18:58:42: Q. You hadn't treated with Dr. O'Hearn for
Line 10, 18:58:42: anything else before this?
Line 11, 18:58:42: A. No.
Line 12, 18:58:42: Q. Okay. They did the surgery in May of 2003.
Line 13, 18:58:42: Tell me about your recovery after that surgery.
Line 14, 18:58:42: A. I went back to the therapy center. They did
Line 15, 18:58:42: therapy, then like a month later after the scarring
Line 16, 18:58:42: healed they put me in aquatic therapy.
Line 17, 18:58:42: Q. When you say scarring, you mean the scabs
Line 18, 18:58:42: from the surgery?
Line 19, 18:58:42: A. Yeah. After all that healed up, they put me
Line 20, 18:58:42: in aquatic therapy which is the pool.
Line 21, 18:58:42: Q. Right.
Line 22, 18:58:42: A. And they help you do exercise and stuff
Line 23, 18:58:42: inside the pool.

Line 3, 18:58:46: symptoms in your knee?
Line 4, 18:58:46: A. No, there's no slippage, nothing like
Line 5, 18:58:46: stability wise. I feel okay. But I just -- I get
Line 6, 18:58:46: pain,
Line 7, 18:58:46: Q. About how often do you get pain?
Line 8, 18:58:46: A. It depends on activity. I would say probably
Line 9, 18:58:46: about four or five times a week. It depends how long
Line 10, 18:58:46: I'm on it.
Line 11, 18:58:46: Q. Okay. What type of activity causes the pain?
Line 12, 18:58:46: A. Well, just being on it all day or walking.
Line 13, 18:58:46: Like if I go to the mall or something, a couple hours
Line 14, 18:58:46: of driving a stick shift vehicle.
Line 15, 18:58:46: Q. Do you have a stick shift vehicle?
Line 16, 18:58:46: A. Not anymore. My wife's -- my girlfriend's
Line 17, 18:58:46: brother, he has a stick shift vehicie. Sometimes he
Line 18, 18:58:46: needs to use mine because mine has more space and
Line 19, 18:58:46: I'll use his to go to work.
Line 20, 18:58:46: Q. Well, if you do that, though, you're not
Line 21, 18:58:46: several hours behind the wheel?
Line 22, 18:58:46: A. Not several hours, but the clutch and stuff.

Line 3, 18:58:46: Page 66
Line 4, 18:58:46: You've mentioned being on it and then driving a stick
Line 5, 18:58:46: shift can cause pain. Anything else that you do
Line 6, 18:58:46: specifically that causes pain?
Line 7, 18:58:46: A. I can't think of anything right now.
Line 8, 18:58:46: Q. Okay. And I think the answers to
Line 9, 18:58:46: interrogatories mentioned part of your job is
Line 10, 18:58:46: shoveling?
Line 11, 18:58:46: A. Yes.
Line 12, 18:58:46: Q. When you're doing shoveling, does that cause
Line 13, 18:58:46: problems with your knee either while you're working
Line 14, 18:58:46: or later?
Line 15, 18:58:46: A. What I do when I'm shoveling now is
Line 16, 18:58:46: of using my right leg -- you know, when you
Line 17, 18:58:46: you've got to kick the shovel in to be able
Line 18, 18:58:46: the dirt out,
Line 19, 18:58:46: Q. This is when you're digging like contaminated
Line 20, 18:58:46: soil or something like that?
Line 21, 18:58:46: A. Yeah. So what I do is kick with my left
Line 22, 18:58:46: instead of kicking with my right.
Line 23, 18:58:46: Q. So you rest on the right and you do the work
Line 24, 18:58:46: with the left?

Line 5, 18:58:46: Q. How often do you have to do digging as part
Line 6, 18:58:46: of your job?
Line 7, 18:58:46: A. Not often. Probably out of a month probably
Line 8, 18:58:46: twice.
Line 9, 18:58:46: Q. Okay. Obviously that's only on land spiils
Line 10, 18:58:46: or something like that?
Line 11, 18:58:46: A. Yeah. We don't have many water spills
Line 12, 18:58:46: either.
Line 13, 18:58:46: Q. Right. So you indicated your knee feels okay
Line 14, 18:58:46: stability wise, but you get pain four or five times a
Line 15, 18:58:46: week?
Line 16, 18:58:46: A. Yeah.
Line 17, 18:58:46: What do you do for the pain?
Line 18, 18:58:46: Aspercreme or Flexall.
Line 19, 18:58:46: And those are both over the counter, right?
Line 20, 18:58:46: A. Yeah.
Line 21, 18:58:46: Q. Do you do that at night when you get home or
Line 22, 18:58:46: do you do it on the job? How often do you have to
Line 23, 18:58:46: apply that?
Line 24, 18:58:46: A. I'1l carry a tube of Flexall with me every

Line 4, 18:58:46: once in a while. Sometimes in the morning I'll wake
Line 5, 18:58:46: up and I'll have that pain, so I know I have to carry
Line 6, 18:58:46: it with me.
Line 7, 18:58:46: Q. Is there anything that your knee condition
Line 8, 18:58:46: prevents you from doing today that you could do back
Line 9, 18:58:46: before February of 2003?
Line 10, 18:58:46: A. Well, I was running around riding a bike and
Line 11, 18:58:46: stuff. I'm not doing that anymore. I might jump on
Line 12, 18:58:46: a motorcycle every now and then, but I'm not pedaling
Line 13, 18:58:46: a bike or anything anymore.
Line 14, 18:58:46: Q. How often were you riding a bike back in
Line 15, 18:58:46: February of 2003 before this occurred?
Line 16, 18:58:46: A. I went out whenever my stepson wanted to go
Line 17, 18:58:46: out probably about once a week.
Line 18, 18:58:46: Q. Did you have your own bike?
Line 19, 18:58:46: A. Yeah.
Line 20, 18:58:46: Do you still have it?
Line 21, 18:58:46: No.
Line 22, 18:58:46: Q. And when would you ride with him?

Line 4, 18:58:50: Q. Anything else that you can't do today -- I
Line 5, 18:58:50: don't even remember if I asked that question, but I
Line 6, 18:58:50: will now. Is that something you can't do today that
Line 7, 18:58:50: you could do before?
Line 8, 18:58:50: A. Ride a bike?
Line 9, 18:58:50: Right.
Line 10, 18:58:50: No, I can't do it now.
Line 11, 18:58:50: Okay. And has a doctor told you not to do
Line 12, 18:58:50: A. Not that I can't do it, just I don't want to
Line 13, 18:58:50: do anything that might aggravate my knee. I probably
Line 14, 18:58:50: can, but I don't want to do it because it's just the
Line 15, 18:58:50: fear of getting hurt again I guess.
Line 16, 18:58:50: Q. And when did you start riding a bike after
Line 17, 18:58:50: your prior surgery in, say -- which was I guess
Line 18, 18:58:50: November of 2000?
Line 19, 18:58:50: A. Probably about a year, year and a half
Line 20, 18:58:50: afterwards.
Line 21, 18:58:50: Q. So then for -- you could ride a bike for
Line 22, 18:58:50: about a year and a half?
