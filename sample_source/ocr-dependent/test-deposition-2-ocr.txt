Line 7, 19:00:10: A. Okay.
Line 8, 19:00:10: Q. I'm going to ask you some questions about /
Line 9, 19:00:10: your background, about the accident and about your
Line 10, 19:00:10: injuries.
Line 11, 19:00:10: A. Okay.

Line 13, 19:00:10: I'm here to get information, so if I ask you

Line 17, 19:00:10: A. Definitely.

Line 21, 19:00:10: what I asked you?
Line 22, 19:00:10: A. Yes, sir.
Line 23, 19:00:10: Q. Okay. It's very important we don't both
Line 24, 19:00:10: speak at the same time. The court reporter can go
Line 25, 19:00:10: fairly quickly, but she cannot take down two people
Line 26, 19:00:10: talking at once. She can only record one thread of

Line 10, 19:00:10: A. Yes, sir.
Line 11, 19:00:10: Q. Okay. And the same way, except for you
Line 12, 19:00:10: to, I heard you say what day the accident was, I've
Line 13, 19:00:10: never spoken to you before, and so I don't know your
Line 14, 19:00:10: pattern of speech. You may be thinking of some more
Line 15, 19:00:10: information you want to share to answer a question,
Line 16, 19:00:10: but I may think you're completed. I never intend to
Line 17, 19:00:10: interrupt you. If I've interrupted you and you have
Line 18, 19:00:10: not given me the complete answer, will you ask me to
Line 19, 19:00:10: let you finish the answer?
Line 20, 19:00:10: A. Yes, sir.
Line 21, 19:00:10: Q. I can ask you a lot of questions, and the
Line 22, 19:00:10: more I ask, the more detailed I get, and at some

Line 36, 19:00:10: A. Yes, I do, sir.

Line 15, 19:00:13: but for some reason, the past couple days, they've i
Line 16, 19:00:13: been doing a lot of construction work, so I decided,
Line 17, 19:00:13: you know, I used to take that route along -- a lot,
Line 18, 19:00:13: so I figured I'd just go back to the same route
Line 19, 19:00:13: again, so I was going down east to North Point Road
Line 20, 19:00:13: to I guess it's a cut off after Quad Avenue, and
Line 21, 19:00:13: that takes me onto Pulaski. :
Line 22, 19:00:13: Q. So you're on North Point Road, and if the :
Line 23, 19:00:13: accident wouldn't have happened, you would have gone
Line 24, 19:00:13: past Quad?
Line 25, 19:00:13: A. Correct.
Line 26, 19:00:13: Q. And you would have turned in what
Line 27, 19:00:13: direction?
Line 28, 19:00:13: A. I guess it would be going maybe west.
Line 29, 19:00:13: I meant right or left.
Line 30, 19:00:13: Oh, I'm sorry. Right.
Line 31, 19:00:13: Right, onto?
Line 32, 19:00:13: Onto Pulaski Highway.
Line 33, 19:00:13: Q. And then from Pulaski Highway, you take
Line 34, 19:00:13: that all the way out to --
Line 35, 19:00:13: A. Yes, about a half a mile to where it takes

Line 3, 19:00:13: Page 12
Line 4, 19:00:13: me to 67th Street.
Line 5, 19:00:13: Q. Okay. The road you were on where the
Line 6, 19:00:13: accident happened is called what?
Line 7, 19:00:13: A. That is North Point Road.
Line 8, 19:00:13: Q. Okay. How long had you been on North :
Line 9, 19:00:13: Point Road before the area where the accident
Line 10, 19:00:13: occurred, how far?
Line 11, 19:00:13: A. From Edgemere, coming out of Edgemere,
Line 12, 19:00:13: about 12 1/2 miles.
Line 13, 19:00:13: Q. So you'd been on North Point Road for
Line 14, 19:00:13: 12 1/2 miles? 4
Line 15, 19:00:13: A. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. /
Line 16, 19:00:13: Q. And as you're approaching the area where
Line 17, 19:00:13: the accident happened, describe North Point Road to
Line 18, 19:00:13: me, how many lanes and that sort of thing. ‘
Line 19, 19:00:13: A. Going down North Point all the way from
Line 20, 19:00:13: Edgemere, it's two lanes all the way in. Once you
Line 21, 19:00:13: hit Kane, I guess it goes to Kane Street, the
Line 22, 19:00:13: intersection there. If you're coming down, it goes
Line 23, 19:00:13: down to two until you hit the underpass, and then it

Line 17, 19:00:17: Q. Okay. Now, when did you first see the

Line 5, 19:00:17: where was it?
Line 6, 19:00:17: A. He was in the righthand lane, and I was in :
Line 7, 19:00:17: the left lane coming down North Point.
Line 8, 19:00:17: Q. And when you first saw the truck, where
Line 9, 19:00:17: was it in relation to you? In other words, I ;

Line 14, 19:00:17: Uh-huh.
Line 15, 19:00:17: Yes? :
Line 16, 19:00:17: Yes, sir.
Line 17, 19:00:17: Q. And then, and then what happened next?
Line 18, 19:00:17: A. And then as we came under the underpass,
Line 19, 19:00:17: he got into the lane splits out where it comes down
Line 20, 19:00:17: the three lanes. I put my blinker on. I went into
Line 21, 19:00:17: the right lane. He went into the very center lane, |
Line 22, 19:00:17: and then we were following each other all the way
Line 23, 19:00:17: down about, I guess about a quarter of a mile before
Line 24, 19:00:17: we came to the, the impact.

Line 5, 19:00:17: in the right lane and you're in the left lane,
Line 6, 19:00:17: right?
Line 7, 19:00:17: A. Okay. I'm in the right lane, he's in the
Line 8, 19:00:17: left lane.
Line 9, 19:00:17: Q. Oh, I misunderstood you.
Line 10, 19:00:17: A. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. My right and left.
Line 11, 19:00:17: MR. MILLER: I thought he had it right,
Line 12, 19:00:17: actually. I could be wrong. P
Line 13, 19:00:17: A. No, as we were coming down, I was in the
Line 14, 19:00:17: righthand lane, he was in the left lane as we were
Line 15, 19:00:17: coming down underneath the underpass.
Line 16, 19:00:17: Q. Okay. i

Line 4, 19:00:17: get it right. So when it was two lanes, the truck
Line 5, 19:00:17: is in the left?
Line 6, 19:00:17: A. Correct.
Line 7, 19:00:17: Q. And you were to the truck's right?
Line 8, 19:00:17: A. In the right.
Line 9, 19:00:17: Q. Now, when a third lane is created, does
Line 10, 19:00:17: that appear on the righthand side --
Line 11, 19:00:17: A. Yes, it does.
Line 12, 19:00:17: Q. -- or on the lefthand side? The right?
Line 13, 19:00:17: A. The right side, right. That's what I
Line 14, 19:00:17: Meant coming over.
Line 15, 19:00:17: Q. Okay. So when the right lane is created,
Line 16, 19:00:17: did I understand that you moved over one lane to the
Line 17, 19:00:17: right?
Line 18, 19:00:17: A. Yes, I did.
Line 19, 19:00:17: QO. And the truck moved over one lane so it's
Line 20, 19:00:17: in the second lane from the right?
Line 21, 19:00:17: A. Correct.
Line 22, 19:00:17: Q. Okay. And as you're driving along North

Line 5, 19:00:21: A. His truck was here, and I was right behind
Line 6, 19:00:21: his door --
Line 7, 19:00:21: Q. You need to -- let me interrupt you. You
Line 8, 19:00:21: need to use words like behind his door. That's
Line 9, 19:00:21: good. Here doesn't work because they can only take
Line 10, 19:00:21: down what you say.
Line 11, 19:00:21: A. I know.
Line 12, 19:00:21: Q. So you need to describe it in words.
Line 13, 19:00:21: A. We were going eastbound. The tractor
Line 14, 19:00:21: trailer was in the left lane, I was in the right :
Line 15, 19:00:21: lane and I was adjacent to his door.
Line 16, 19:00:21: Q. The door?
Line 17, 19:00:21: A. The back side of his door, of the tractor
Line 18, 19:00:21: trailer, because I remember looking over. We
Line 19, 19:00:21: weren't going fast at all. I remember looking over f[
Line 20, 19:00:21: and seeing the numbers that was on the side of the i
Line 21, 19:00:21: door because I felt -- I never seen a truck that big |
Line 22, 19:00:21: with -- it hardly had, didn't have a very big load :
Line 23, 19:00:21: on it. '

Line 3, 19:00:21: load?
Line 4, 19:00:21: A. It only had a couple pallets on it, and I
Line 5, 19:00:21: thought it was kind of a big truck for being in such
Line 6, 19:00:21: a little area, that little area of road.
Line 7, 19:00:21: Q. What kind of trailer was attached to the
Line 8, 19:00:21: tractor?
Line 9, 19:00:21: A. It was a big trailer. ;
Line 10, 19:00:21: Q. Well, in other words, there's the box
Line 11, 19:00:21: trailer that has walls and so forth --
Line 12, 19:00:21: A. No, it was a open trailer. It was a open
Line 13, 19:00:21: trailer, and I just remember looking over and seeing [|
Line 14, 19:00:21: that, you know, because I was right beside him.
Line 15, 19:00:21: Q. An open trailer is what people sometimes
Line 16, 19:00:21: call a flatbed where it's just a --
Line 17, 19:00:21: A. That's what it was, yes.
Line 18, 19:00:21: Q. -- a bed and you see the product sitting :
Line 19, 19:00:21: on there, and you're saying there weren't many of :
Line 20, 19:00:21: them?
Line 21, 19:00:21: A. Didn't look there was many of them. It
Line 22, 19:00:21: was a couple pallets, and I didn't know what was in

Line 4, 19:00:21: 1 Q. Okay. So as you're driving along, before
Line 5, 19:00:21: the lane split, before we add the lane to the right,
Line 6, 19:00:21: you're in the right lane, the truck's in the left,
Line 7, 19:00:21: and your, the front of your -- what are you driving?
Line 8, 19:00:21: A green pickup, right?
Line 9, 19:00:21: 6 A. I have a very big truck. I have a truck,
Line 10, 19:00:21: a Dodge Daytona -- a Dodge Dakota.
Line 11, 19:00:21: 8 Q. Okay. And that's lined up, the front of
Line 12, 19:00:21: your pickup is, is alongside --
Line 13, 19:00:21: 10 A. Yeah, to where the front of his door, yes.
Line 14, 19:00:21: 11 Q. The front of --
Line 15, 19:00:21: 12 A. Towards --
Line 16, 19:00:21: 13 MR. MILLER: I got to caution you both to
Line 17, 19:00:21: 15 Q. Go on, Qi
Line 18, 19:00:21: 16 A. My, my front of my truck was in like the
Line 19, 19:00:21: middle of his door to the end of his door where you
Line 20, 19:00:21: open it up.
Line 21, 19:00:21: 19 Q. Okay. And then a lane is added on the

Line 4, 19:00:21: Q. And then what did you do? Did you move q
Line 5, 19:00:21: into the right lane?
Line 6, 19:00:21: A. Yes. I put my blinker on and I moved into
Line 7, 19:00:21: the right lane because that exit, that lane takes me
Line 8, 19:00:21: to my exit.
Line 9, 19:00:21: Q. Okay. And did the truck put its right
Line 10, 19:00:21: turn signal on and move into the lane that you had
Line 11, 19:00:21: previously --
Line 12, 19:00:21: A. No, he did not.
Line 13, 19:00:21: Okay. What did the truck do next?
Line 14, 19:00:21: A. He just basically had gotten into that
Line 15, 19:00:21: lane when I moved over. He had gotten into that
Line 16, 19:00:21: lane, and I moved over into my lane.
Line 17, 19:00:21: Q. Okay. Were you and the truck going
Line 18, 19:00:21: approximately the same speed, or is one of you going
Line 19, 19:00:21: faster than the other?
Line 20, 19:00:21: A. Probably exactly the same, because we were
Line 21, 19:00:21: staying up at the same pace all the way down.
Line 22, 19:00:21: Q. And what speed was that?
Line 23, 19:00:21: A. I'd say no more than 15, 20 miles, because
Line 24, 19:00:21: it's only a 30 mile, 25 to 30 mile speed zone there.

Line 4, 19:00:24: Q. Okay. What happened next?
Line 5, 19:00:24: 2 A. Then next, all I know is that we had came
Line 6, 19:00:24: up to I guess where he was making a turn, and alls I
Line 7, 19:00:24: know is I was just going down. I put my blinker on
Line 8, 19:00:24: to make the turn because it's at the next light.
Line 9, 19:00:24: Went to put my blinker on to make that turn, and all
Line 10, 19:00:24: of a sudden, he was in front of me. His truck just
Line 11, 19:00:24: came completely in front of me, and T went
Line 12, 19:00:24: underneath the back end of his front tire.
Line 13, 19:00:24: 10 Q. And what part of the truck hit what part
Line 14, 19:00:24: of your pickup?
Line 15, 19:00:24: 12 A. The front of my truck, the side of my
Line 16, 19:00:24: truck. The driver's side.
Line 17, 19:00:24: 14 Q. And what part of the tractor was hit?
Line 18, 19:00:24: 15 A. I mean, the tire to the back frame, I
Line 19, 19:00:24: guess. I don't know.
Line 20, 19:00:24: 17 Q. Did you see any damage to the truck?
Line 21, 19:00:24: 18 A. I really wasn't looking. I was ina lot
Line 22, 19:00:24: of pain myself. I really wasn't --
Line 23, 19:00:24: 20 Q. What damage was done to your pickup?

Line 8, 19:00:24: the pictures that you could point out to me? :
Line 9, 19:00:24: A. No, that's it. There was some damage done
Line 10, 19:00:24: to the motor of the car, I think, because I had to
Line 11, 19:00:24: take it back to Thompson Dodge because it was doing
Line 12, 19:00:24: so much rattling, and they had to do something to
Line 13, 19:00:24: the steering.
Line 14, 19:00:24: Q. Okay. So the two of you were going
Line 15, 19:00:24: alongside of each other on North Point for a period
Line 16, 19:00:24: of time at about the same speed, and did you ever
Line 17, 19:00:24: see a turn signal on the truck?
Line 18, 19:00:24: A. No, sir, I did not.
Line 19, 19:00:24: Q. Can you describe to me the angle of the
Line 20, 19:00:24: tractor when it hit you? Do you know what I mean?
Line 21, 19:00:24: Was it sort of side to side or the tractor turned
Line 22, 19:00:24: 90 degrees?
Line 23, 19:00:24: A. He didn't turn because I figured I

Line 7, 19:00:24: If I would have seen him turn or even be in the
Line 8, 19:00:24: middle of any of the lanes, I would have seen that
Line 9, 19:00:24: compared to my truck, I would have seen him pull
Line 10, 19:00:24: away from my truck. The front of the truck would
Line 11, 19:00:24: have pulled away from my truck instead of being so
Line 12, 19:00:24: close to my truck.
Line 13, 19:00:24: (Exhibit 4 marked.)

Line 15, 19:00:24: Q. Let me show you the police report for the
Line 16, 19:00:24: accident --
Line 17, 19:00:24: A. sure.
Line 18, 19:00:24: Q. -- which we've marked as Exhibit 4. The
Line 19, 19:00:24: police officer wasn't there, so he didn't see the
Line 20, 19:00:24: accident, but he drew a diagram.
Line 21, 19:00:24: A. Uh-huh.
Line 22, 19:00:24: Q. Does that diagram to your way of thinking
Line 23, 19:00:24: accurately show the angle of the tractor in relation |
Line 24, 19:00:24: to the angle of your pickup?

Line 4, 19:00:28: A. Yes, it does, because his whole trailer
Line 5, 19:00:28: was in his lane, and that lane, it was not over in
Line 6, 19:00:28: any of the lanes.
Line 7, 19:00:28: Q. Okay. And the front of the tractor had :
Line 8, 19:00:28: turned close to 90 degrees towards your truck?
Line 9, 19:00:28: A. Correct.
Line 10, 19:00:28: Q. So in other words, trying to perceive what
Line 11, 19:00:28: happened, it wasn't like the truck was sort of
Line 12, 19:00:28: sliding over to the right?
Line 13, 19:00:28: A. Right.
Line 14, 19:00:28: Q. It was like a sharp right turn?
Line 15, 19:00:28: A. Yeah.
Line 16, 19:00:28: Q. Okay. Describe to me the impact as you
Line 17, 19:00:28: experienced it.
Line 18, 19:00:28: A. It was a hard impact, very hard. I mean,
Line 19, 19:00:28: I, I hurt my hand. I mean, everything just -- my
Line 20, 19:00:28: hand just completely just went (indicating).
Line 21, 19:00:28: Severe, severe pain. There was a point where as

Line 9, 19:00:28: came in over my, just came in front of me, and it
Line 10, 19:00:28: was like boom. There was no stopping. There was
Line 11, 19:00:28: nowhere I could just, just slam on the brakes or

Line 7, 19:00:28: 4 A. No, they opened up the door. No, they

Line 5, 19:00:31: 3 Q. Fifteen seems like a slow speed for a car

Line 10, 19:00:31: kept telling me to calm down.
Line 11, 19:00:31: 8 Q. What did they tell you was wrong?
Line 12, 19:00:31: 9 A. They said that they know that there

Line 14, 19:00:31: something broken, definitely. They wanted to take
Line 15, 19:00:31: me to x-rays to find out. After they brought me out
Line 16, 19:00:31: of x-rays, I seen like four or five doctors. They
Line 17, 19:00:31: kept coming in and saying about having to go into
Line 18, 19:00:31: 15 surgery, that they were trying to get me into
Line 19, 19:00:31: surgery right away. They were trying to get

Line 9, 19:00:39: Q. Okay. Sometime in January, did you see
Line 10, 19:00:39: A. Probably, yes. :
Line 11, 19:00:39: Q. Why did you --
Line 12, 19:00:39: A. I'm just estimating, because I had went in
Line 13, 19:00:39: for Qa, «GUERIN nad wanted me to see a
Line 14, 19:00:39: all> who specializes in pain management so
Line 15, 19:00:39: they could do some ganglion stellate blockages to :
Line 16, 19:00:39: stop the nerve endings from the pain that they were |
Line 17, 19:00:39: causing, and I had that done at Johns Hopkins on
Line 18, 19:00:39: December 7th.
Line 19, 19:00:39: Q. What did you have done at Johns Hopkins on
Line 20, 19:00:39: December 7th? '
Line 21, 19:00:39: A. It's called a stellate, S-T-E-L-L-A-G-E,
Line 22, 19:00:39: ganglion, G-A-L-L-I-O-N, blockage. That's where

Line 4, 19:00:39: nerves that go in through the arms underneath the
Line 5, 19:00:39: chest.
Line 6, 19:00:39: Q. And what's the purpose of that?
Line 7, 19:00:39: A. It deadens the nerves, because what
Line 8, 19:00:39: happens is when you have severe nerve damage, it's
Line 9, 19:00:39: like electrical impulses going off. It's like
Line 10, 19:00:39: taking a cord and fraying it and all the electrical ;
Line 11, 19:00:39: impulses going all over the place. That's what
Line 12, 19:00:39: causes the pain in the tissues, so what they do is :
Line 13, 19:00:39: they block it off so it doesn't go down that far.
Line 14, 19:00:39: It just leaves an even line. |
Line 15, 19:00:39: Q. Do you have the records of that procedure? :

Line 5, 19:00:39: Q. And then who did you -- why did you stop
Line 6, 19:00:39: seeing as
Line 7, 19:00:39: A. Because I didn't have any more money to --
Line 8, 19:00:39: I kept paying for all the medical bills, and I'ma
Line 9, 19:00:39: Single person. I can't afford to keep putting
Line 10, 19:00:39: out -- it was costing me $30 to see him every time I
Line 11, 19:00:39: seen him, and you know, my medical insurance will :
Line 12, 19:00:39: only cover so much, and then after with physical
Line 13, 19:00:39: therapy as well, my deductible, I had to pay my
Line 14, 19:00:39: deductible in this, so every time I had to see him :
Line 15, 19:00:39: thereafter, I couldn't afford it. They cut my hours
Line 16, 19:00:39: back at work and everything because I was missing a f[
Line 17, 19:00:39: lot of time. ]
Line 18, 19:00:39: Q. So you stopped seeing En because

Line 22, 19:00:39: A. No, I could not.

Line 17, 19:00:39: I couldn't afford to see a doctor because of the
Line 18, 19:00:39: fact of how much it was costing me, so he wanted me
Line 19, 19:00:39: to sec QM sto see if we could work something
Line 20, 19:00:39: out with them, and they work the same way. I would
Line 21, 19:00:39: still have to pay the deductible.

Line 25, 19:00:39: A. Right.

Line 29, 19:00:39: Q. I'm sorry. Go ahead. Go ahead.
Line 30, 19:00:39: A. Okay. And then a couple weeks ago, that's
Line 31, 19:00:39: when I started with the pain in here, and that's
Line 32, 19:00:39: when I called Johns Hopkins to talk to FP
Line 33, 19:00:39: about making an appointment and they told me he was
