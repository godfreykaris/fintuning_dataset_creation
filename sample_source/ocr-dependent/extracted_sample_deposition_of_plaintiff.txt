Sometimes my questions are going to be very
foreseeable, you'll know what I'm going to be asking,
but I do ask that you wait until I get done. Because
we have a court repQpm@emrtrereyt and he's taking down
everything I say, everything you say and it's just a
lot easier if only one of us is talking at a time.
A. Okay.
Q. And the other thing would be if the answer is
yes or no and you nod, I probably know what you mean,
but he's going to do a transcript of what we say here
today, and it just,might-=not be clear :threegmontalse+
from now. So answer out loud yes or ano. And like
I say, if you’re not sure about where the question's
going, just tell me and I4]11 try to restate it. You
gave your address. How long have you been at that
address?
A. Two and a half years, three years.

Q. And when you said we, would you -- you have
to do whatever comes up?
A. Yeah.
Q. What's involved in the basic clean up of,
say, an oil spill? When I say what's involved, I
mean what would your duties be, what do you have to
do?
A. My duties would be to contain the oil spill,
just throw down a boom which is --
you're talking about a spill on the water,
could be on the water or on land. Like we
had one at a gas station where all we had to do was
throw padding down and pick up the padding and just
pressure wash it down, and that was it, we were done.
Q. How about if it's on the water or on a river?
A. Well, if it's on the water, we'll go ina
boat -- if it requires a boat, and we'll throw the
Sausage boom down.
Q. Okay. Then does the sausage boom absorb the
oil or does it just contain it?
(410) 268-6006 - 1-866-337-6778

A, It pulls up the oil, leaves the water behind,
lets the water go through it.
Q. And what do you do then with the sausage boom
then?
A. The sausage boom gets pulled in.
QO. And how's that done?
A. With -- they look like broomsticks with hooks
on it.
Q. But you have to manually do that or is it
winched in? I'm just wondering what your duties are.
A. They'll pull it in. Like our boat has the
winch, and just unhook it as pulls in.
Q. Okay. I'm really kind of looking to explore
what the physical nature of your job is. Do you
consider it a physical job or moderate or light duty?
A. No, it's light.
Q. Light duty?
A. It's light.
Q. When you say you have to -- sometimes you
have to throw down the padding, how much does the
padding way?

QO. Yeah.
A. Not even a pound, not even 12 ounces. It's
like a quarter-inch thick piece of paper like a paper
towel.
Q. So you're just sopping it up?
A. Yeah.
Q. So you don't -- it's not like big rolls of
this that you're dealing with?
A. No, they're just cut out pads probably
16-by-16.
Q. When you pick them up, where do you put them?
A. In trash bags or in drums.
Do you have to carry the trash bags?
Not me.
Q. Not you?
A. No, because when I got hired I was told -- I
toid them about my limitations, so they work with me
on that.
Q. What's the most you have to lift as far as
weight wise?

Q. What's the kind of bulkiest type of item you
have to do, whether it's the 30 pounds or 40 pounds
or something else? Is there some odd shape that you
ever have to deal with?
A. No.
Q. When were you hired at QM, when
did you start there?
A. Early November, late October of this past
year, 2003.
Q. Who's your boss?
\. SP .
Does he have a titie?
He runs the --
MS. ZOIS: Boss.

how I got in there.

Q. He's just --
He's just the head man in charge.
Is he the one who actually hired you?
A. Yeah, he did the hiring.
Q. And you mentioned that you told him about
your limitations?
A. Yeah.
Q. When you. applied there back in November or
October of 2003, what limitations did you tell him
you had?
A. No heavy lifting. What else. I think that
was it. No heavy lifting and nothing that's just
going to hurt my knee.
QO. And as far as -- are there any parts of the
job that most chemical technicians can handie that
you do not do?
A. The moving of the drums. If they have soil

filled drums, I won't touch them unless there's a
drum cart. Sometimes there's no drum carts. With a
drum cart you can just --
Q. It's on wheels?
A. Yeah, it's on wheels. It has two wheels down
at the bottom and then another two about halfway up,
and you just push it or pull and it’s light.
Q. When you say push -- you showed me, you kind
of tilted it over?
A. You tilt it down and it's laying on the other
back wheels, and you just give it a push.
Q. All right.
A. But if there's no drum carts I won't touch
Q. Okay. How do they typically if there's not a
drum cart move the barrels or the drums?
A. Well, they'll grab them with their left or
right hand, whatever, and they'll break it back and
roll it.
Q. Okay. I guess they're sealed at this point?
A. Yes.

but he didn't cut hair.
Okay. He liked being the owner?
Yeah, exactly.
You were the laborer?
I was the worker.
Q. I see. When did that shut down?

months off of two years+s !
Q. And were you a partner with
A. Uh-huh.
Q. He had the master barber's license. Did you
have any training as a barber?
A. I went to barber school for about four months
and didn't agree with the teacher's way of teaching,
because I was already cutting hair before.
Q. Why don't I just run back through your
employment history, and then you can kind of explain
that to me. Before you were working in the barber
shop -- before I even get there, while you've been
working at que, have you been working
anywhere else, any other jobs?

No, just cutting hair out of my garage.
Okay. Abous how much -- how often do you do
Probably about six times a week.
Okay. And when you do that, is that -- are
you doing it for one customer, several customers a
day?
No, usually one customer, one or two.
But most days you end up cutting somgone's
If it’s feasible with my job schedule.
What kind of hours do you work at @jil®
ee
A. That's an issue because you're on call.
You're guaranteed to work over eight hours a day.
Q. And on an average day -- or an average week?
A. Let's just say I'll do anywhere from usual 40
to about 55, 60 hours a week.
Q. Anda then you'll sometimes -- at least as long
as you're mot kept at a spill, you come home and cut
someone's hair once or -- six days a week?

A. Yeah.
Q. All right. Before that you were at the
barber shop. Other than working at the barber shop,
did you have any other employment?
A. No. Well, my girlfriend -- I had given her
money, she opened up a grocery store. So I used to
go in and out of the grocery store, help her out. As
a matter of fact, the day of the accident, I was
working the grocery store because barber shops are
closed on Mondays.
QO. Okay. Was that a form of employment? Were
you getting paid at all for working there?
A. No.
Q. Does she still own that grocery store?
A. No, we closed it down because after the
accident -- well, we didn't close it down, we sold
it. After the accident, her grandpa came down with
Alzheimer's and she had gotten pregnant, so we had no
way of taking care of the store.
Q. Had the grandfather been working there too?
A. No, her grandmother had been helping her out

with the store. So she had to stay home because of
her grandpa.
Q. And then your girlfriend was pregnant so she
needed more time away so you sold the store?
Yeah,
But that wasn't related to this accident,
the selling of the store?
Somewhat.
Somewhat?
Because I couldn't help out as much as TI did.
Well --
If there was nobody at the store, I'd run the
barber shop and the store.
Q. Were they right next to each other?
Yeah.
And that would work I guess for as long as no
in the barber shop?
Uh-huh.
Were these operations run under corporate
names or under your individual names?
A. Well, the store was called the Bum

<a the grocery store. It was a Latino
specialty store. The barber shop was gis,
Q. Me does that stand for something?
A. It does, but I don't remember what it did.
My partner, he had it named already, he just had
never opened the place up. I came in, put money
then we opened up.
Q. And then you were also doing the bulk or
of the haircutting?
A. Yeah.
Q. What kind of hours did you work there?
A. Tuesday through Wednesday it was from 12:
o'clock to 7:00 o'clock. Friday and Saturday --
Friday was from 12:00 o'clock until about 8:00 or

were working those type of hours, you sometimes would
either keep an eye on the grocery store or work there
on Mondays?
A. Yeah.
Q. Did you also work there after or before you
got started doing these hours? That was a horrible
question, excuse me. You mentioned that you worked
on Thursdays and Fridays from 12:00 to 8:00. Maybe
before 12:00 did you ever work at the grocery store?
A. Yes.
Q. And did you ever work back in the grocery
store after this accident occurred?

11 Q. The knee, was it improved at all with the
therapy or did the therapy just not help?
13 A. No, it wasn't doing much. Basically what the
doctor said, that they were going to do the therapy
to strengthen the knee for surgery. This way I'd
have supposedly a quicker recovery.

A. I went back to the therapy center. They did
therapy, then like a month later after the scarring
healed they put me in aquatic therapy.

in aquatic therapy which is the pool.

symptoms in your knee?
A. No, there's no slippage, nothing like
stability wise. I feel okay. But I just -- I get
pain,
Q. About how often do you get pain?
A. It depends on activity. I would say probably
about four or five times a week. It depends how long
I'm on it.
Q. Okay. What type of activity causes the pain?
A. Well, just being on it all day or walking.
Like if I go to the mall or something, a couple hours
of driving a stick shift vehicle.
Q. Do you have a stick shift vehicle?
A. Not anymore. My wife's -- my girlfriend's
brother, he has a stick shift vehicie. Sometimes he
needs to use mine because mine has more space and
I'll use his to go to work.
Q. Well, if you do that, though, you're not
several hours behind the wheel?
A. Not several hours, but the clutch and stuff.

You've mentioned being on it and then driving a stick
shift can cause pain. Anything else that you do
specifically that causes pain?
A. I can't think of anything right now.
Q. Okay. And I think the answers to
interrogatories mentioned part of your job is
shoveling?
A. Yes.
Q. When you're doing shoveling, does that cause
problems with your knee either while you're working
or later?
A. What I do when I'm shoveling now is
of using my right leg -- you know, when you
you've got to kick the shovel in to be able
the dirt out,
Q. This is when you're digging like contaminated
soil or something like that?
A. Yeah. So what I do is kick with my left
instead of kicking with my right.
Q. So you rest on the right and you do the work
with the left?

What do you do for the pain?
Aspercreme or Flexall.
And those are both over the counter, right?

do you do it on the job? How often do you have to
apply that?

up and I'll have that pain, so I know I have to carry

Q. Is there anything that your knee condition
prevents you from doing today that you could do back
before February of 2003?
A. Well, I was running around riding a bike and
stuff. I'm not doing that anymore. I might jump on
a motorcycle every now and then, but I'm not pedaling
a bike or anything anymore.
Q. How often were you riding a bike back in

do anything that might aggravate my knee. I probably
can, but I don't want to do it because it's just the
fear of getting hurt again I guess.
