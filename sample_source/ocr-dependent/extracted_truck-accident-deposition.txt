but I may think you're completed. I never intend to
interrupt you. If I've interrupted you and you have
not given me the complete answer, will you ask me to
let you finish the answer?

been doing a lot of construction work, so I decided,
you know, I used to take that route along -- a lot,
so I figured I'd just go back to the same route
again, so I was going down east to North Point Road
to I guess it's a cut off after Quad Avenue, and
that takes me onto Pulaski. :
Q. So you're on North Point Road, and if the :
accident wouldn't have happened, you would have gone
past Quad?
A. Correct.
Q. And you would have turned in what
direction?

I meant right or left.

me to 67th Street.
Q. Okay. The road you were on where the
accident happened is called what?
A. That is North Point Road.
Q. Okay. How long had you been on North :
Point Road before the area where the accident
occurred, how far?
A. From Edgemere, coming out of Edgemere,
about 12 1/2 miles.
Q. So you'd been on North Point Road for
12 1/2 miles? 4
A. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. /
Q. And as you're approaching the area where
the accident happened, describe North Point Road to
me, how many lanes and that sort of thing. ‘
A. Going down North Point all the way from
Edgemere, it's two lanes all the way in. Once you
hit Kane, I guess it goes to Kane Street, the
intersection there. If you're coming down, it goes
down to two until you hit the underpass, and then it

goes into three.

Q. So it's two lanes in the direction you're f[
heading --
A. Uh-huh.
Q. -- and it becomes three?
A. It becomes three lanes once you go
underneath the underpass. It's Kane Street.
Q. And how far, the spot where it becomes
three lanes, how far is that from the area where the
accident happened? :
A. Maybe 300 feet, 400 feet.
Q. Okay. Pretty close to where the accident?
A. Yeah, yeah. I would say it's no less than :
a quarter -- it was less than a quarter mile. |
Q. Okay. Now, when did you first see the
truck that was involved in this accident? j
A. Coming down North Point Road, coming :
eastbound when he crossed over the intersection of !
Kane and coming down.
Q. How far were you from the accident scene
when you first saw the truck?
A. About, probably about a quarter mile. |

Q. Okay. And when you first saw the truck,
where was it?
A. He was in the righthand lane, and I was in :
the left lane coming down North Point.
Q. And when you first saw the truck, where
was it in relation to you? In other words, I ;
understand it was in the right lane, you were :
left lane?
A. Beside me.
You were alongside of each other?
Uh-huh.
Yes? :
Yes, sir.
Q. And then, and then what happened next?
A. And then as we came under the underpass,
he got into the lane splits out where it comes down
the three lanes. I put my blinker on. I went into
the right lane. He went into the very center lane, |
and then we were following each other all the way
down about, I guess about a quarter of a mile before
we came to the, the impact.

is in the left?
A. Correct.
Q. And you were to the truck's right?
A. In the right.
Q. Now, when a third lane is created, does
that appear on the righthand side --

Meant coming over.
Q. Okay. So when the right lane is created,
did I understand that you moved over one lane to the
right?
A. Yes, I did.

in the second lane from the right?
A. Correct.

to each other? In other words, who was in front of

A. His truck was here, and I was right behind
his door --
Q. You need to -- let me interrupt you. You
need to use words like behind his door. That's
good. Here doesn't work because they can only take
down what you say.
A. I know.
Q. So you need to describe it in words.
A. We were going eastbound. The tractor
trailer was in the left lane, I was in the right :
lane and I was adjacent to his door.
Q. The door?
A. The back side of his door, of the tractor
trailer, because I remember looking over. We
weren't going fast at all. I remember looking over f[
and seeing the numbers that was on the side of the i
door because I felt -- I never seen a truck that big |
with -- it hardly had, didn't have a very big load :
on it. '
Q. What do you mean, it didn't have a big

load?
A. It only had a couple pallets on it, and I
thought it was kind of a big truck for being in such
a little area, that little area of road.
Q. What kind of trailer was attached to the
tractor?
A. It was a big trailer. ;
Q. Well, in other words, there's the box
trailer that has walls and so forth --
A. No, it was a open trailer. It was a open
trailer, and I just remember looking over and seeing [|
that, you know, because I was right beside him.
Q. An open trailer is what people sometimes
call a flatbed where it's just a --
A. That's what it was, yes.
Q. -- a bed and you see the product sitting :
on there, and you're saying there weren't many of :
them?
A. Didn't look there was many of them. It
was a couple pallets, and I didn't know what was in
the pallets. :

the lane split, before we add the lane to the right,
you're in the right lane, the truck's in the left,
and your, the front of your -- what are you driving?
A green pickup, right?
6 A. I have a very big truck. I have a truck,
a Dodge Daytona -- a Dodge Dakota.

your pickup is, is alongside --

Q. And then what did you do? Did you move q
into the right lane?
A. Yes. I put my blinker on and I moved into
the right lane because that exit, that lane takes me
to my exit.
Q. Okay. And did the truck put its right
turn signal on and move into the lane that you had
previously --
A. No, he did not.
Okay. What did the truck do next?
A. He just basically had gotten into that
lane when I moved over. He had gotten into that
lane, and I moved over into my lane.
Q. Okay. Were you and the truck going
approximately the same speed, or is one of you going
faster than the other?
A. Probably exactly the same, because we were
staying up at the same pace all the way down.
Q. And what speed was that?
A. I'd say no more than 15, 20 miles, because
it's only a 30 mile, 25 to 30 mile speed zone there.

Q. Okay. What happened next?
2 A. Then next, all I know is that we had came
up to I guess where he was making a turn, and alls I
know is I was just going down. I put my blinker on
to make the turn because it's at the next light.
Went to put my blinker on to make that turn, and all
of a sudden, he was in front of me. His truck just
came completely in front of me, and T went
underneath the back end of his front tire.
10 Q. And what part of the truck hit what part
of your pickup?
12 A. The front of my truck, the side of my
truck. The driver's side.
14 Q. And what part of the tractor was hit?
15 A. I mean, the tire to the back frame, I
guess. I don't know.

of pain myself. I really wasn't --

your left front?
A. Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Q. Is there any other damage you can see in |
the pictures that you could point out to me? :
A. No, that's it. There was some damage done
to the motor of the car, I think, because I had to
take it back to Thompson Dodge because it was doing
so much rattling, and they had to do something to
the steering.
Q. Okay. So the two of you were going
alongside of each other on North Point for a period
of time at about the same speed, and did you ever
see a turn signal on the truck?
A. No, sir, I did not.
Q. Can you describe to me the angle of the
tractor when it hit you? Do you know what I mean?
Was it sort of side to side or the tractor turned
90 degrees?
A. He didn't turn because I figured I
probably would have seen if he would have went out

of the lines, because I mean, the road is very small }
on that side. On the right side, the lane is a real
small lane. I mean, that tractor trailer was big.
If I would have seen him turn or even be in the
middle of any of the lanes, I would have seen that
compared to my truck, I would have seen him pull
away from my truck. The front of the truck would
have pulled away from my truck instead of being so
close to my truck.

accident, but he drew a diagram.
A. Uh-huh.

accurately show the angle of the tractor in relation |
to the angle of your pickup?

A. Yes, it does, because his whole trailer
was in his lane, and that lane, it was not over in
any of the lanes.
Q. Okay. And the front of the tractor had :
turned close to 90 degrees towards your truck?
A. Correct.
Q. So in other words, trying to perceive what
happened, it wasn't like the truck was sort of
sliding over to the right?
A. Right.
Q. It was like a sharp right turn?
A. Yeah.
Q. Okay. Describe to me the impact as you
experienced it.
A. It was a hard impact, very hard. I mean,
I, I hurt my hand. I mean, everything just -- my
hand just completely just went (indicating).
Severe, severe pain. There was a point where as
soon as the impact, I was crying because of the
severe pain. 4

wrist, we understand?
A. Yeah.
Q. How did that happen; do you know?
A. I don't know. I mean, I was holding onto
the steering wheel, and I don't know what happened.
I mean, it just, the impact, because I mean, he just
came in over my, just came in front of me, and it
was like boom. There was no stopping. There was
nowhere I could just, just slam on the brakes or
anything. There was no -- it was there. It just
happened.

other than your left wrist and hand?

than my hand.

and then a young woman come up behind me and she H

nerves that go in through the arms underneath the
chest.
Q. And what's the purpose of that?
A. It deadens the nerves, because what
happens is when you have severe nerve damage, it's
like electrical impulses going off. It's like
taking a cord and fraying it and all the electrical ;
impulses going all over the place. That's what
causes the pain in the tissues, so what they do is :
they block it off so it doesn't go down that far.
It just leaves an even line. |
