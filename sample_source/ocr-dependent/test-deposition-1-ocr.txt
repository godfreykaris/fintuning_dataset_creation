Line 7, 18:59:26: A. Okay.
Line 8, 18:59:26: Q. I'm going to ask you some questions about /
Line 9, 18:59:26: your background, about the accident and about your
Line 10, 18:59:26: injuries.
Line 11, 18:59:26: A. Okay.

Line 13, 18:59:26: I'm here to get information, so if I ask you

Line 17, 18:59:26: A. Definitely.

Line 21, 18:59:26: what I asked you?
Line 22, 18:59:26: A. Yes, sir.
Line 23, 18:59:26: Q. Okay. It's very important we don't both
Line 24, 18:59:26: speak at the same time. The court reporter can go
Line 25, 18:59:26: fairly quickly, but she cannot take down two people
Line 26, 18:59:26: talking at once. She can only record one thread of

Line 11, 18:59:26: Q. Okay. And the same way, except for you
Line 12, 18:59:26: to, I heard you say what day the accident was, I've
Line 13, 18:59:26: never spoken to you before, and so I don't know your
Line 14, 18:59:26: pattern of speech. You may be thinking of some more
Line 15, 18:59:26: information you want to share to answer a question,
Line 16, 18:59:26: but I may think you're completed. I never intend to
Line 17, 18:59:26: interrupt you. If I've interrupted you and you have
Line 18, 18:59:26: not given me the complete answer, will you ask me to
Line 19, 18:59:26: let you finish the answer?
Line 20, 18:59:26: A. Yes, sir.
Line 21, 18:59:26: Q. I can ask you a lot of questions, and the
Line 22, 18:59:26: more I ask, the more detailed I get, and at some

Line 36, 18:59:26: A. Yes, I do, sir.

Line 15, 18:59:30: but for some reason, the past couple days, they've i
Line 16, 18:59:30: been doing a lot of construction work, so I decided,
Line 17, 18:59:30: you know, I used to take that route along -- a lot,
Line 18, 18:59:30: so I figured I'd just go back to the same route
Line 19, 18:59:30: again, so I was going down east to North Point Road
Line 20, 18:59:30: to I guess it's a cut off after Quad Avenue, and
Line 21, 18:59:30: that takes me onto Pulaski. :
Line 22, 18:59:30: Q. So you're on North Point Road, and if the :
Line 23, 18:59:30: accident wouldn't have happened, you would have gone
Line 24, 18:59:30: past Quad?
Line 25, 18:59:30: A. Correct.
Line 26, 18:59:30: Q. And you would have turned in what
Line 27, 18:59:30: direction?
Line 28, 18:59:30: A. I guess it would be going maybe west.
Line 29, 18:59:30: I meant right or left.
Line 30, 18:59:30: Oh, I'm sorry. Right.
Line 31, 18:59:30: Right, onto?
Line 32, 18:59:30: Onto Pulaski Highway.
Line 33, 18:59:30: Q. And then from Pulaski Highway, you take
Line 34, 18:59:30: that all the way out to --
Line 35, 18:59:30: A. Yes, about a half a mile to where it takes

Line 3, 18:59:30: Page 12
Line 4, 18:59:30: me to 67th Street.
Line 5, 18:59:30: Q. Okay. The road you were on where the
Line 6, 18:59:30: accident happened is called what?
Line 7, 18:59:30: A. That is North Point Road.
Line 8, 18:59:30: Q. Okay. How long had you been on North :
Line 9, 18:59:30: Point Road before the area where the accident
Line 10, 18:59:30: occurred, how far?
Line 11, 18:59:30: A. From Edgemere, coming out of Edgemere,
Line 12, 18:59:30: about 12 1/2 miles.
Line 13, 18:59:30: Q. So you'd been on North Point Road for
Line 14, 18:59:30: 12 1/2 miles? 4
Line 15, 18:59:30: A. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. /
Line 16, 18:59:30: Q. And as you're approaching the area where
Line 17, 18:59:30: the accident happened, describe North Point Road to
Line 18, 18:59:30: me, how many lanes and that sort of thing. ‘
Line 19, 18:59:30: A. Going down North Point all the way from
Line 20, 18:59:30: Edgemere, it's two lanes all the way in. Once you
Line 21, 18:59:30: hit Kane, I guess it goes to Kane Street, the
Line 22, 18:59:30: intersection there. If you're coming down, it goes
Line 23, 18:59:30: down to two until you hit the underpass, and then it

Line 17, 18:59:33: Q. Okay. Now, when did you first see the

Line 4, 18:59:33: Q. Okay. And when you first saw the truck,
Line 5, 18:59:33: where was it?
Line 6, 18:59:33: A. He was in the righthand lane, and I was in :
Line 7, 18:59:33: the left lane coming down North Point.
Line 8, 18:59:33: Q. And when you first saw the truck, where
Line 9, 18:59:33: was it in relation to you? In other words, I ;

Line 14, 18:59:33: Uh-huh.
Line 15, 18:59:33: Yes? :

Line 17, 18:59:33: Q. And then, and then what happened next?
Line 18, 18:59:33: A. And then as we came under the underpass,
Line 19, 18:59:33: he got into the lane splits out where it comes down
Line 20, 18:59:33: the three lanes. I put my blinker on. I went into
Line 21, 18:59:33: the right lane. He went into the very center lane, |
Line 22, 18:59:33: and then we were following each other all the way
Line 23, 18:59:33: down about, I guess about a quarter of a mile before
Line 24, 18:59:33: we came to the, the impact.

Line 5, 18:59:33: in the right lane and you're in the left lane,
Line 6, 18:59:33: right?
Line 7, 18:59:33: A. Okay. I'm in the right lane, he's in the
Line 8, 18:59:33: left lane.
Line 9, 18:59:33: Q. Oh, I misunderstood you.
Line 10, 18:59:33: A. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. My right and left.
Line 11, 18:59:33: MR. MILLER: I thought he had it right,
Line 12, 18:59:33: actually. I could be wrong. P
Line 13, 18:59:33: A. No, as we were coming down, I was in the
Line 14, 18:59:33: righthand lane, he was in the left lane as we were
Line 15, 18:59:33: coming down underneath the underpass.
Line 16, 18:59:33: Q. Okay. i

Line 4, 18:59:33: get it right. So when it was two lanes, the truck
Line 5, 18:59:33: is in the left?
Line 6, 18:59:33: A. Correct.
Line 7, 18:59:33: Q. And you were to the truck's right?
Line 8, 18:59:33: A. In the right.
Line 9, 18:59:33: Q. Now, when a third lane is created, does
Line 10, 18:59:33: that appear on the righthand side --
Line 11, 18:59:33: A. Yes, it does.
Line 12, 18:59:33: Q. -- or on the lefthand side? The right?
Line 13, 18:59:33: A. The right side, right. That's what I
Line 14, 18:59:33: Meant coming over.
Line 15, 18:59:33: Q. Okay. So when the right lane is created,
Line 16, 18:59:33: did I understand that you moved over one lane to the
Line 17, 18:59:33: right?
Line 18, 18:59:33: A. Yes, I did.
Line 19, 18:59:33: QO. And the truck moved over one lane so it's
Line 20, 18:59:33: in the second lane from the right?
Line 21, 18:59:33: A. Correct.
Line 22, 18:59:33: Q. Okay. And as you're driving along North

Line 5, 18:59:37: A. His truck was here, and I was right behind
Line 6, 18:59:37: his door --
Line 7, 18:59:37: Q. You need to -- let me interrupt you. You
Line 8, 18:59:37: need to use words like behind his door. That's
Line 9, 18:59:37: good. Here doesn't work because they can only take
Line 10, 18:59:37: down what you say.
Line 11, 18:59:37: A. I know.
Line 12, 18:59:37: Q. So you need to describe it in words.
Line 13, 18:59:37: A. We were going eastbound. The tractor
Line 14, 18:59:37: trailer was in the left lane, I was in the right :
Line 15, 18:59:37: lane and I was adjacent to his door.
Line 16, 18:59:37: Q. The door?
Line 17, 18:59:37: A. The back side of his door, of the tractor
Line 18, 18:59:37: trailer, because I remember looking over. We
Line 19, 18:59:37: weren't going fast at all. I remember looking over f[
Line 20, 18:59:37: and seeing the numbers that was on the side of the i
Line 21, 18:59:37: door because I felt -- I never seen a truck that big |
Line 22, 18:59:37: with -- it hardly had, didn't have a very big load :

Line 4, 18:59:37: A. It only had a couple pallets on it, and I
Line 5, 18:59:37: thought it was kind of a big truck for being in such
Line 6, 18:59:37: a little area, that little area of road.
Line 7, 18:59:37: Q. What kind of trailer was attached to the
Line 8, 18:59:37: tractor?
Line 9, 18:59:37: A. It was a big trailer. ;
Line 10, 18:59:37: Q. Well, in other words, there's the box
Line 11, 18:59:37: trailer that has walls and so forth --
Line 12, 18:59:37: A. No, it was a open trailer. It was a open
Line 13, 18:59:37: trailer, and I just remember looking over and seeing [|
Line 14, 18:59:37: that, you know, because I was right beside him.
Line 15, 18:59:37: Q. An open trailer is what people sometimes
Line 16, 18:59:37: call a flatbed where it's just a --
Line 17, 18:59:37: A. That's what it was, yes.
Line 18, 18:59:37: Q. -- a bed and you see the product sitting :
Line 19, 18:59:37: on there, and you're saying there weren't many of :
Line 20, 18:59:37: them?
Line 21, 18:59:37: A. Didn't look there was many of them. It
Line 22, 18:59:37: was a couple pallets, and I didn't know what was in

Line 4, 18:59:37: 1 Q. Okay. So as you're driving along, before
Line 5, 18:59:37: the lane split, before we add the lane to the right,
Line 6, 18:59:37: you're in the right lane, the truck's in the left,
Line 7, 18:59:37: and your, the front of your -- what are you driving?
Line 8, 18:59:37: A green pickup, right?
Line 9, 18:59:37: 6 A. I have a very big truck. I have a truck,
Line 10, 18:59:37: a Dodge Daytona -- a Dodge Dakota.
Line 11, 18:59:37: 8 Q. Okay. And that's lined up, the front of
Line 12, 18:59:37: your pickup is, is alongside --

Line 14, 18:59:37: 11 Q. The front of --
Line 15, 18:59:37: 12 A. Towards --
Line 16, 18:59:37: 13 MR. MILLER: I got to caution you both to
Line 17, 18:59:37: 15 Q. Go on, Qi
Line 18, 18:59:37: 16 A. My, my front of my truck was in like the
Line 19, 18:59:37: middle of his door to the end of his door where you
Line 20, 18:59:37: open it up.
Line 21, 18:59:37: 19 Q. Okay. And then a lane is added on the

Line 4, 18:59:37: Q. And then what did you do? Did you move q
Line 5, 18:59:37: into the right lane?
Line 6, 18:59:37: A. Yes. I put my blinker on and I moved into
Line 7, 18:59:37: the right lane because that exit, that lane takes me
Line 8, 18:59:37: to my exit.
Line 9, 18:59:37: Q. Okay. And did the truck put its right
Line 10, 18:59:37: turn signal on and move into the lane that you had
Line 11, 18:59:37: previously --
Line 12, 18:59:37: A. No, he did not.
Line 13, 18:59:37: Okay. What did the truck do next?
Line 14, 18:59:37: A. He just basically had gotten into that
Line 15, 18:59:37: lane when I moved over. He had gotten into that
Line 16, 18:59:37: lane, and I moved over into my lane.
Line 17, 18:59:37: Q. Okay. Were you and the truck going
Line 18, 18:59:37: approximately the same speed, or is one of you going
Line 19, 18:59:37: faster than the other?
Line 20, 18:59:37: A. Probably exactly the same, because we were
Line 21, 18:59:37: staying up at the same pace all the way down.
Line 22, 18:59:37: Q. And what speed was that?
Line 23, 18:59:37: A. I'd say no more than 15, 20 miles, because
Line 24, 18:59:37: it's only a 30 mile, 25 to 30 mile speed zone there.

Line 4, 18:59:41: Q. Okay. What happened next?
Line 5, 18:59:41: 2 A. Then next, all I know is that we had came
Line 6, 18:59:41: up to I guess where he was making a turn, and alls I
Line 7, 18:59:41: know is I was just going down. I put my blinker on
Line 8, 18:59:41: to make the turn because it's at the next light.
Line 9, 18:59:41: Went to put my blinker on to make that turn, and all
Line 10, 18:59:41: of a sudden, he was in front of me. His truck just
Line 11, 18:59:41: came completely in front of me, and T went
Line 12, 18:59:41: underneath the back end of his front tire.
Line 13, 18:59:41: 10 Q. And what part of the truck hit what part
Line 14, 18:59:41: of your pickup?
Line 15, 18:59:41: 12 A. The front of my truck, the side of my
Line 16, 18:59:41: truck. The driver's side.
Line 17, 18:59:41: 14 Q. And what part of the tractor was hit?
Line 18, 18:59:41: 15 A. I mean, the tire to the back frame, I
Line 19, 18:59:41: guess. I don't know.
Line 20, 18:59:41: 17 Q. Did you see any damage to the truck?
Line 21, 18:59:41: 18 A. I really wasn't looking. I was ina lot
Line 22, 18:59:41: of pain myself. I really wasn't --
Line 23, 18:59:41: 20 Q. What damage was done to your pickup?

Line 8, 18:59:41: the pictures that you could point out to me? :
Line 9, 18:59:41: A. No, that's it. There was some damage done
Line 10, 18:59:41: to the motor of the car, I think, because I had to
Line 11, 18:59:41: take it back to Thompson Dodge because it was doing
Line 12, 18:59:41: so much rattling, and they had to do something to
Line 13, 18:59:41: the steering.
Line 14, 18:59:41: Q. Okay. So the two of you were going
Line 15, 18:59:41: alongside of each other on North Point for a period
Line 16, 18:59:41: of time at about the same speed, and did you ever
Line 17, 18:59:41: see a turn signal on the truck?
Line 18, 18:59:41: A. No, sir, I did not.
Line 19, 18:59:41: Q. Can you describe to me the angle of the
Line 20, 18:59:41: tractor when it hit you? Do you know what I mean?
Line 21, 18:59:41: Was it sort of side to side or the tractor turned
Line 22, 18:59:41: 90 degrees?
Line 23, 18:59:41: A. He didn't turn because I figured I

Line 7, 18:59:41: If I would have seen him turn or even be in the
Line 8, 18:59:41: middle of any of the lanes, I would have seen that
Line 9, 18:59:41: compared to my truck, I would have seen him pull
Line 10, 18:59:41: away from my truck. The front of the truck would
Line 11, 18:59:41: have pulled away from my truck instead of being so
Line 12, 18:59:41: close to my truck.
Line 13, 18:59:41: (Exhibit 4 marked.)

Line 15, 18:59:41: Q. Let me show you the police report for the
Line 16, 18:59:41: accident --
Line 17, 18:59:41: A. sure.
Line 18, 18:59:41: Q. -- which we've marked as Exhibit 4. The
Line 19, 18:59:41: police officer wasn't there, so he didn't see the
Line 20, 18:59:41: accident, but he drew a diagram.
Line 21, 18:59:41: A. Uh-huh.
Line 22, 18:59:41: Q. Does that diagram to your way of thinking
Line 23, 18:59:41: accurately show the angle of the tractor in relation |
Line 24, 18:59:41: to the angle of your pickup?

Line 4, 18:59:44: A. Yes, it does, because his whole trailer
Line 5, 18:59:44: was in his lane, and that lane, it was not over in
Line 6, 18:59:44: any of the lanes.
Line 7, 18:59:44: Q. Okay. And the front of the tractor had :
Line 8, 18:59:44: turned close to 90 degrees towards your truck?
Line 9, 18:59:44: A. Correct.
Line 10, 18:59:44: Q. So in other words, trying to perceive what
Line 11, 18:59:44: happened, it wasn't like the truck was sort of
Line 12, 18:59:44: sliding over to the right?
Line 13, 18:59:44: A. Right.
Line 14, 18:59:44: Q. It was like a sharp right turn?
Line 15, 18:59:44: A. Yeah.
Line 16, 18:59:44: Q. Okay. Describe to me the impact as you
Line 17, 18:59:44: experienced it.
Line 18, 18:59:44: A. It was a hard impact, very hard. I mean,
Line 19, 18:59:44: I, I hurt my hand. I mean, everything just -- my
Line 20, 18:59:44: hand just completely just went (indicating).
Line 21, 18:59:44: Severe, severe pain. There was a point where as

Line 7, 18:59:44: the steering wheel, and I don't know what happened.
Line 8, 18:59:44: I mean, it just, the impact, because I mean, he just
Line 9, 18:59:44: came in over my, just came in front of me, and it
Line 10, 18:59:44: was like boom. There was no stopping. There was
Line 11, 18:59:44: nowhere I could just, just slam on the brakes or
Line 12, 18:59:44: anything. There was no -- it was there. It just

Line 6, 18:59:44: to you?
Line 7, 18:59:44: 4 A. No, they opened up the door. No, they

Line 5, 18:59:48: 3 Q. Fifteen seems like a slow speed for a car

Line 7, 18:59:48: going only 15.
Line 8, 18:59:48: 6 A. Because we weren't going that fast beacuse
Line 9, 18:59:48: that road's not that -- that lane is not that wide.

Line 10, 18:59:48: kept telling me to calm down.
Line 11, 18:59:48: 8 Q. What did they tell you was wrong?
Line 12, 18:59:48: 9 A. They said that they know that there
Line 13, 18:59:48: cut, and it looked like there might have been
Line 14, 18:59:48: something broken, definitely. They wanted to take
Line 15, 18:59:48: me to x-rays to find out. After they brought me out
Line 16, 18:59:48: of x-rays, I seen like four or five doctors. They
Line 17, 18:59:48: kept coming in and saying about having to go into
Line 18, 18:59:48: 15 surgery, that they were trying to get me into
Line 19, 18:59:48: surgery right away. They were trying to get
Line 20, 18:59:48: somebody in to do the surgery because they said that
Line 21, 18:59:48: there was no waiting for the surgery to get -- they
Line 22, 18:59:48: It had to be done

Line 9, 18:59:55: Q. Okay. Sometime in January, did you see
Line 10, 18:59:55: A. Probably, yes. :
Line 11, 18:59:55: Q. Why did you --
Line 12, 18:59:55: A. I'm just estimating, because I had went in
Line 13, 18:59:55: for Qa, «GUERIN nad wanted me to see a
Line 14, 18:59:55: all> who specializes in pain management so
Line 15, 18:59:55: they could do some ganglion stellate blockages to :
Line 16, 18:59:55: stop the nerve endings from the pain that they were |
Line 17, 18:59:55: causing, and I had that done at Johns Hopkins on
Line 18, 18:59:55: December 7th.
Line 19, 18:59:55: Q. What did you have done at Johns Hopkins on
Line 20, 18:59:55: December 7th? '
Line 21, 18:59:55: A. It's called a stellate, S-T-E-L-L-A-G-E,
Line 22, 18:59:55: ganglion, G-A-L-L-I-O-N, blockage. That's where

Line 4, 18:59:55: nerves that go in through the arms underneath the
Line 5, 18:59:55: chest.
Line 6, 18:59:55: Q. And what's the purpose of that?
Line 7, 18:59:55: A. It deadens the nerves, because what
Line 8, 18:59:55: happens is when you have severe nerve damage, it's
Line 9, 18:59:55: like electrical impulses going off. It's like
Line 10, 18:59:55: taking a cord and fraying it and all the electrical ;
Line 11, 18:59:55: impulses going all over the place. That's what
Line 12, 18:59:55: causes the pain in the tissues, so what they do is :
Line 13, 18:59:55: they block it off so it doesn't go down that far.
Line 14, 18:59:55: It just leaves an even line. |
Line 15, 18:59:55: Q. Do you have the records of that procedure? :

Line 5, 18:59:55: Q. And then who did you -- why did you stop
Line 6, 18:59:55: seeing as
Line 7, 18:59:55: A. Because I didn't have any more money to --
Line 8, 18:59:55: I kept paying for all the medical bills, and I'ma
Line 9, 18:59:55: Single person. I can't afford to keep putting
Line 10, 18:59:55: out -- it was costing me $30 to see him every time I
Line 11, 18:59:55: seen him, and you know, my medical insurance will :
Line 12, 18:59:55: only cover so much, and then after with physical
Line 13, 18:59:55: therapy as well, my deductible, I had to pay my
Line 14, 18:59:55: deductible in this, so every time I had to see him :
Line 15, 18:59:55: thereafter, I couldn't afford it. They cut my hours
Line 16, 18:59:55: back at work and everything because I was missing a f[
Line 17, 18:59:55: lot of time. ]
Line 18, 18:59:55: Q. So you stopped seeing En because

Line 22, 18:59:55: A. No, I could not.

Line 17, 18:59:55: I couldn't afford to see a doctor because of the
Line 18, 18:59:55: fact of how much it was costing me, so he wanted me
Line 19, 18:59:55: to sec QM sto see if we could work something
Line 20, 18:59:55: out with them, and they work the same way. I would
Line 21, 18:59:55: still have to pay the deductible.

Line 25, 18:59:55: A. Right.
Line 26, 18:59:55: Q. So when did you start seeing ay

Line 29, 18:59:55: Q. I'm sorry. Go ahead. Go ahead.
Line 30, 18:59:55: A. Okay. And then a couple weeks ago, that's
Line 31, 18:59:55: when I started with the pain in here, and that's
Line 32, 18:59:55: when I called Johns Hopkins to talk to FP
Line 33, 18:59:55: about making an appointment and they told me he was

Line 9, 19:00:02: you lost wages of from August 7th to October 23,
Line 10, 19:00:02: 114.5 hours?
Line 11, 19:00:02: A. Yeah. That was mostly through physical
Line 12, 19:00:02: therapy and stuff, because I only took four days off
Line 13, 19:00:02: from the accident. TI had to be back, I was back at |
Line 14, 19:00:02: work the following week after the surgery because
Line 15, 19:00:02: like I said, I have no long-term disability. I
Line 16, 19:00:02: exhausted all my, my time. I've been there 11
Line 17, 19:00:02: years, and I get three weeks vacation. I exhausted
Line 18, 19:00:02: all my, my two weeks vacation and my five personal
Line 19, 19:00:02: days. :
Line 20, 19:00:02: Q. Okay. So if the accident happened on a
Line 21, 19:00:02: Friday, when did you return to work?
Line 22, 19:00:02: A. The following Monday. /
Line 23, 19:00:02: Q. You mean you took off the week after -- :

Line 7, 19:00:02: Q. Okay. And then the other hours are
Line 8, 19:00:02: Physical therapy.
Line 9, 19:00:02: Mostly for physical therapy --
Line 10, 19:00:02: Yep.
Line 11, 19:00:02: Q. -- and doctor's appointments?
Line 12, 19:00:02: A. Yes, because my doctor would only take me,
Line 13, 19:00:02: last visit's one o'clock, so from one o'clock, he
Line 14, 19:00:02: would -- I would be there like two or three hours.
Line 15, 19:00:02: Our business closes at five, so I lose a half a day
Line 16, 19:00:02: of work.
Line 17, 19:00:02: Q. Okay. In this packet, do we have a
Line 18, 19:00:02: statement from the employer or anything about what
Line 19, 19:00:02: days she missed or anything like that?
Line 20, 19:00:02: A. There should be, yes, because that's what
Line 21, 19:00:02: you got from my -- there was copies on my payroll.
Line 22, 19:00:02: (Discussion off the record.)

Line 14, 19:00:02: MR. MILES: And you'll give me copy of the

Line 12, 19:18:00: to, I heard you say what day the accident was, I've
Line 13, 19:18:00: never spoken to you before, and so I don't know your

Line 6, 19:18:43: to know about how it works, let me know.
Line 7, 19:18:43: A. Okay.
Line 8, 19:18:43: Q. I'm going to ask you some questions about /
Line 9, 19:18:43: your background, about the accident and about your
Line 10, 19:18:43: injuries.
Line 11, 19:18:43: A. Okay.

Line 13, 19:18:43: I'm here to get information, so if I ask you

Line 16, 19:18:43: ea ears
Line 17, 19:18:43: A. Definitely.

Line 20, 19:18:43: SS ee
Line 21, 19:18:43: what I asked you?
Line 22, 19:18:43: A. Yes, sir.
Line 23, 19:18:43: Q. Okay. It's very important we don't both
Line 24, 19:18:43: speak at the same time. The court reporter can go
Line 25, 19:18:43: fairly quickly, but she cannot take down two people
Line 26, 19:18:43: talking at once. She can only record one thread of

Line 8, 19:18:43: Q. And that will also ensure that you've

Line 10, 19:18:43: A. Yes, sir.
Line 11, 19:18:43: Q. Okay. And the same way, except for you
Line 12, 19:18:43: to, I heard you say what day the accident was, I've
Line 13, 19:18:43: never spoken to you before, and so I don't know your
Line 14, 19:18:43: pattern of speech. You may be thinking of some more
Line 15, 19:18:43: information you want to share to answer a question,
Line 16, 19:18:43: but I may think you're completed. I never intend to

Line 18, 19:18:43: not given me the complete answer, will you ask me to
Line 19, 19:18:43: let you finish the answer?
Line 20, 19:18:43: A. Yes, sir.
Line 21, 19:18:43: Q. I can ask you a lot of questions, and the
Line 22, 19:18:43: more I ask, the more detailed I get, and at some
Line 23, 19:18:43: point, you'll find I get to the point where I've

Line 23, 19:18:43: perjury, and you understand what that means?
Line 24, 19:18:43: A. Yes, I do, sir.

Line 4, 19:18:47: but for some reason, the past couple days, they've i
Line 5, 19:18:47: been doing a lot of construction work, so I decided,
Line 6, 19:18:47: you know, I used to take that route along -- a lot,
Line 7, 19:18:47: so I figured I'd just go back to the same route
Line 8, 19:18:47: again, so I was going down east to North Point Road
Line 9, 19:18:47: to I guess it's a cut off after Quad Avenue, and
Line 10, 19:18:47: that takes me onto Pulaski. :
Line 11, 19:18:47: Q. So you're on North Point Road, and if the :
Line 12, 19:18:47: accident wouldn't have happened, you would have gone
Line 13, 19:18:47: past Quad?
Line 14, 19:18:47: A. Correct.
Line 15, 19:18:47: Q. And you would have turned in what
Line 16, 19:18:47: direction?
Line 17, 19:18:47: A. I guess it would be going maybe west.
Line 18, 19:18:47: I meant right or left.
Line 19, 19:18:47: Oh, I'm sorry. Right.
Line 20, 19:18:47: Right, onto?
Line 21, 19:18:47: Onto Pulaski Highway.
Line 22, 19:18:47: Q. And then from Pulaski Highway, you take
Line 23, 19:18:47: that all the way out to --
Line 24, 19:18:47: A. Yes, about a half a mile to where it takes

Line 4, 19:18:47: me to 67th Street.
Line 5, 19:18:47: Q. Okay. The road you were on where the
Line 6, 19:18:47: accident happened is called what?
Line 7, 19:18:47: A. That is North Point Road.
Line 8, 19:18:47: Q. Okay. How long had you been on North :
Line 9, 19:18:47: Point Road before the area where the accident
Line 10, 19:18:47: occurred, how far?
Line 11, 19:18:47: A. From Edgemere, coming out of Edgemere,
Line 12, 19:18:47: about 12 1/2 miles.
Line 13, 19:18:47: Q. So you'd been on North Point Road for
Line 14, 19:18:47: 12 1/2 miles? 4
Line 15, 19:18:47: A. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. /
Line 16, 19:18:47: Q. And as you're approaching the area where
Line 17, 19:18:47: the accident happened, describe North Point Road to
Line 18, 19:18:47: me, how many lanes and that sort of thing. ‘
Line 19, 19:18:47: A. Going down North Point all the way from
Line 20, 19:18:47: Edgemere, it's two lanes all the way in. Once you
Line 21, 19:18:47: hit Kane, I guess it goes to Kane Street, the
Line 22, 19:18:47: intersection there. If you're coming down, it goes
Line 23, 19:18:47: down to two until you hit the underpass, and then it
Line 24, 19:18:47: SSS
Line 25, 19:18:47: goes into three.

Line 9, 19:18:50: underneath the underpass. It's Kane Street.
Line 10, 19:18:50: Q. And how far, the spot where it becomes
Line 11, 19:18:50: three lanes, how far is that from the area where the

Line 13, 19:18:50: A. Maybe 300 feet, 400 feet.
Line 14, 19:18:50: Q. Okay. Pretty close to where the accident?

Line 18, 19:18:50: A. And then as we came under the underpass,
Line 19, 19:18:50: he got into the lane splits out where it comes down
Line 20, 19:18:50: the three lanes. I put my blinker on. I went into
Line 21, 19:18:50: the right lane. He went into the very center lane, |
Line 22, 19:18:50: and then we were following each other all the way
Line 23, 19:18:50: down about, I guess about a quarter of a mile before

Line 6, 19:18:50: right?
Line 7, 19:18:50: A. Okay. I'm in the right lane, he's in the
Line 8, 19:18:50: left lane.
Line 9, 19:18:50: Q. Oh, I misunderstood you.
Line 10, 19:18:50: A. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. My right and left.
Line 11, 19:18:50: MR. MILLER: I thought he had it right,
Line 12, 19:18:50: actually. I could be wrong. P
Line 13, 19:18:50: A. No, as we were coming down, I was in the
Line 14, 19:18:50: righthand lane, he was in the left lane as we were
Line 15, 19:18:50: coming down underneath the underpass.
Line 16, 19:18:50: Q. Okay. i
Line 17, 19:18:50: A. And then the lane goes into three lanes. '
Line 18, 19:18:50: i
Line 19, 19:18:50: i
Line 20, 19:18:50: Okay. We'll get there. I was just making f
Line 21, 19:18:50: Okay.
Line 22, 19:18:50: -- because I think I've heard it both

Line 4, 19:18:50: get it right. So when it was two lanes, the truck
Line 5, 19:18:50: is in the left?
Line 6, 19:18:50: A. Correct.
Line 7, 19:18:50: Q. And you were to the truck's right?
Line 8, 19:18:50: A. In the right.
Line 9, 19:18:50: Q. Now, when a third lane is created, does
Line 10, 19:18:50: that appear on the righthand side --
Line 11, 19:18:50: A. Yes, it does.
Line 12, 19:18:50: Q. -- or on the lefthand side? The right?
Line 13, 19:18:50: A. The right side, right. That's what I
Line 14, 19:18:50: Meant coming over.
Line 15, 19:18:50: Q. Okay. So when the right lane is created,
Line 16, 19:18:50: did I understand that you moved over one lane to the
Line 17, 19:18:50: right?
Line 18, 19:18:50: A. Yes, I did.
Line 19, 19:18:50: QO. And the truck moved over one lane so it's
Line 20, 19:18:50: in the second lane from the right?
Line 21, 19:18:50: A. Correct.
Line 22, 19:18:50: Q. Okay. And as you're driving along North
Line 23, 19:18:50: Point, where are you two positioned in relationship

Line 4, 19:18:54: each other, behind each other, whatever?
Line 5, 19:18:54: A. His truck was here, and I was right behind
Line 6, 19:18:54: his door --
Line 7, 19:18:54: Q. You need to -- let me interrupt you. You
Line 8, 19:18:54: need to use words like behind his door. That's
Line 9, 19:18:54: good. Here doesn't work because they can only take
Line 10, 19:18:54: down what you say.
Line 11, 19:18:54: A. I know.
Line 12, 19:18:54: Q. So you need to describe it in words.
Line 13, 19:18:54: A. We were going eastbound. The tractor
Line 14, 19:18:54: trailer was in the left lane, I was in the right :
Line 15, 19:18:54: lane and I was adjacent to his door.
Line 16, 19:18:54: Q. The door?
Line 17, 19:18:54: A. The back side of his door, of the tractor
Line 18, 19:18:54: trailer, because I remember looking over. We
Line 19, 19:18:54: weren't going fast at all. I remember looking over f[
Line 20, 19:18:54: and seeing the numbers that was on the side of the i
Line 21, 19:18:54: door because I felt -- I never seen a truck that big |
Line 22, 19:18:54: with -- it hardly had, didn't have a very big load :
Line 23, 19:18:54: on it. '

Line 3, 19:18:54: load?
Line 4, 19:18:54: A. It only had a couple pallets on it, and I
Line 5, 19:18:54: thought it was kind of a big truck for being in such
Line 6, 19:18:54: a little area, that little area of road.
Line 7, 19:18:54: Q. What kind of trailer was attached to the
Line 8, 19:18:54: tractor?
Line 9, 19:18:54: A. It was a big trailer. ;
Line 10, 19:18:54: Q. Well, in other words, there's the box
Line 11, 19:18:54: trailer that has walls and so forth --
Line 12, 19:18:54: A. No, it was a open trailer. It was a open
Line 13, 19:18:54: trailer, and I just remember looking over and seeing [|
Line 14, 19:18:54: that, you know, because I was right beside him.
Line 15, 19:18:54: Q. An open trailer is what people sometimes
Line 16, 19:18:54: call a flatbed where it's just a --
Line 17, 19:18:54: A. That's what it was, yes.
Line 18, 19:18:54: Q. -- a bed and you see the product sitting :
Line 19, 19:18:54: on there, and you're saying there weren't many of :
Line 20, 19:18:54: them?
Line 21, 19:18:54: A. Didn't look there was many of them. It
Line 22, 19:18:54: was a couple pallets, and I didn't know what was in
Line 23, 19:18:54: the pallets. :

Line 4, 19:18:54: 1 Q. Okay. So as you're driving along, before
Line 5, 19:18:54: the lane split, before we add the lane to the right,
Line 6, 19:18:54: you're in the right lane, the truck's in the left,
Line 7, 19:18:54: and your, the front of your -- what are you driving?
Line 8, 19:18:54: A green pickup, right?
Line 9, 19:18:54: 6 A. I have a very big truck. I have a truck,
Line 10, 19:18:54: a Dodge Daytona -- a Dodge Dakota.
Line 11, 19:18:54: 8 Q. Okay. And that's lined up, the front of
Line 12, 19:18:54: your pickup is, is alongside --
Line 13, 19:18:54: 10 A. Yeah, to where the front of his door, yes.
Line 14, 19:18:54: 11 Q. The front of --
Line 15, 19:18:54: 12 A. Towards --
Line 16, 19:18:54: 13 MR. MILLER: I got to caution you both to
Line 17, 19:18:54: 15 Q. Go on, Qi
Line 18, 19:18:54: 16 A. My, my front of my truck was in like the
Line 19, 19:18:54: middle of his door to the end of his door where you
Line 20, 19:18:54: open it up.
Line 21, 19:18:54: 19 Q. Okay. And then a lane is added on the

Line 4, 19:18:54: Q. And then what did you do? Did you move q
Line 5, 19:18:54: into the right lane?
Line 6, 19:18:54: A. Yes. I put my blinker on and I moved into
Line 7, 19:18:54: the right lane because that exit, that lane takes me
Line 8, 19:18:54: to my exit.
Line 9, 19:18:54: Q. Okay. And did the truck put its right
Line 10, 19:18:54: turn signal on and move into the lane that you had
Line 11, 19:18:54: previously --
Line 12, 19:18:54: A. No, he did not.
Line 13, 19:18:54: Okay. What did the truck do next?
Line 14, 19:18:54: A. He just basically had gotten into that
Line 15, 19:18:54: lane when I moved over. He had gotten into that
Line 16, 19:18:54: lane, and I moved over into my lane.
Line 17, 19:18:54: Q. Okay. Were you and the truck going
Line 18, 19:18:54: approximately the same speed, or is one of you going
Line 19, 19:18:54: faster than the other?
Line 20, 19:18:54: A. Probably exactly the same, because we were
Line 21, 19:18:54: staying up at the same pace all the way down.
Line 22, 19:18:54: Q. And what speed was that?
Line 23, 19:18:54: A. I'd say no more than 15, 20 miles, because
Line 24, 19:18:54: it's only a 30 mile, 25 to 30 mile speed zone there.

Line 4, 19:18:57: Q. Okay. What happened next?
Line 5, 19:18:57: 2 A. Then next, all I know is that we had came
Line 6, 19:18:57: up to I guess where he was making a turn, and alls I
Line 7, 19:18:57: know is I was just going down. I put my blinker on
Line 8, 19:18:57: to make the turn because it's at the next light.
Line 9, 19:18:57: Went to put my blinker on to make that turn, and all
Line 10, 19:18:57: of a sudden, he was in front of me. His truck just
Line 11, 19:18:57: came completely in front of me, and T went
Line 12, 19:18:57: underneath the back end of his front tire.
Line 13, 19:18:57: 10 Q. And what part of the truck hit what part
Line 14, 19:18:57: of your pickup?
Line 15, 19:18:57: 12 A. The front of my truck, the side of my
Line 16, 19:18:57: truck. The driver's side.
Line 17, 19:18:57: 14 Q. And what part of the tractor was hit?
Line 18, 19:18:57: 15 A. I mean, the tire to the back frame, I
Line 19, 19:18:57: guess. I don't know.
Line 20, 19:18:57: 17 Q. Did you see any damage to the truck?
Line 21, 19:18:57: 18 A. I really wasn't looking. I was ina lot
Line 22, 19:18:57: of pain myself. I really wasn't --
Line 23, 19:18:57: 20 Q. What damage was done to your pickup?

Line 19, 19:18:57: done to your pickup truck in the accident?
Line 20, 19:18:57: A. From what I can tell. The pictures are
Line 21, 19:18:57: quite dark, but yeah.
Line 22, 19:18:57: Q. Obviously, you had a puncture to your left

Line 7, 19:18:57: Q. Is there any other damage you can see in |
Line 8, 19:18:57: the pictures that you could point out to me? :
Line 9, 19:18:57: A. No, that's it. There was some damage done
Line 10, 19:18:57: to the motor of the car, I think, because I had to
Line 11, 19:18:57: take it back to Thompson Dodge because it was doing
Line 12, 19:18:57: so much rattling, and they had to do something to
Line 13, 19:18:57: the steering.
Line 14, 19:18:57: Q. Okay. So the two of you were going
Line 15, 19:18:57: alongside of each other on North Point for a period
Line 16, 19:18:57: of time at about the same speed, and did you ever
Line 17, 19:18:57: see a turn signal on the truck?
Line 18, 19:18:57: A. No, sir, I did not.
Line 19, 19:18:57: Q. Can you describe to me the angle of the
Line 20, 19:18:57: tractor when it hit you? Do you know what I mean?
Line 21, 19:18:57: Was it sort of side to side or the tractor turned
Line 22, 19:18:57: 90 degrees?
Line 23, 19:18:57: A. He didn't turn because I figured I
Line 24, 19:18:57: probably would have seen if he would have went out

Line 5, 19:18:57: on that side. On the right side, the lane is a real
Line 6, 19:18:57: small lane. I mean, that tractor trailer was big.
Line 7, 19:18:57: If I would have seen him turn or even be in the
Line 8, 19:18:57: middle of any of the lanes, I would have seen that
Line 9, 19:18:57: compared to my truck, I would have seen him pull
Line 10, 19:18:57: away from my truck. The front of the truck would
Line 11, 19:18:57: have pulled away from my truck instead of being so
Line 12, 19:18:57: close to my truck.

Line 19, 19:18:57: police officer wasn't there, so he didn't see the

Line 21, 19:18:57: A. Uh-huh.
Line 22, 19:18:57: Q. Does that diagram to your way of thinking
Line 23, 19:18:57: accurately show the angle of the tractor in relation |

Line 4, 19:19:01: A. Yes, it does, because his whole trailer
Line 5, 19:19:01: was in his lane, and that lane, it was not over in
Line 6, 19:19:01: any of the lanes.
Line 7, 19:19:01: Q. Okay. And the front of the tractor had :
Line 8, 19:19:01: turned close to 90 degrees towards your truck?
Line 9, 19:19:01: A. Correct.
Line 10, 19:19:01: Q. So in other words, trying to perceive what
Line 11, 19:19:01: happened, it wasn't like the truck was sort of
Line 12, 19:19:01: sliding over to the right?
Line 13, 19:19:01: A. Right.

Line 17, 19:19:01: experienced it.
Line 18, 19:19:01: A. It was a hard impact, very hard. I mean,
Line 19, 19:19:01: I, I hurt my hand. I mean, everything just -- my
Line 20, 19:19:01: hand just completely just went (indicating).
Line 21, 19:19:01: Severe, severe pain. There was a point where as
Line 22, 19:19:01: soon as the impact, I was crying because of the

Line 7, 19:19:01: the steering wheel, and I don't know what happened.
Line 8, 19:19:01: I mean, it just, the impact, because I mean, he just
Line 9, 19:19:01: came in over my, just came in front of me, and it
Line 10, 19:19:01: was like boom. There was no stopping. There was
Line 11, 19:19:01: nowhere I could just, just slam on the brakes or
Line 12, 19:19:01: anything. There was no -- it was there. It just

Line 4, 19:19:11: nerves that go in through the arms underneath the
Line 5, 19:19:11: chest.
Line 6, 19:19:11: Q. And what's the purpose of that?
Line 7, 19:19:11: A. It deadens the nerves, because what
Line 8, 19:19:11: happens is when you have severe nerve damage, it's
Line 9, 19:19:11: like electrical impulses going off. It's like
Line 10, 19:19:11: taking a cord and fraying it and all the electrical ;
Line 11, 19:19:11: impulses going all over the place. That's what
Line 12, 19:19:11: causes the pain in the tissues, so what they do is :
Line 13, 19:19:11: they block it off so it doesn't go down that far.
Line 14, 19:19:11: It just leaves an even line. |
Line 15, 19:19:11: Q. Do you have the records of that procedure? :

Line 5, 19:19:11: Q. And then who did you -- why did you stop
Line 6, 19:19:11: seeing as
Line 7, 19:19:11: A. Because I didn't have any more money to --
Line 8, 19:19:11: I kept paying for all the medical bills, and I'ma
Line 9, 19:19:11: Single person. I can't afford to keep putting
Line 10, 19:19:11: out -- it was costing me $30 to see him every time I
Line 11, 19:19:11: seen him, and you know, my medical insurance will :
Line 12, 19:19:11: only cover so much, and then after with physical
Line 13, 19:19:11: therapy as well, my deductible, I had to pay my
Line 14, 19:19:11: deductible in this, so every time I had to see him :
Line 15, 19:19:11: thereafter, I couldn't afford it. They cut my hours
Line 16, 19:19:11: back at work and everything because I was missing a f[
Line 17, 19:19:11: lot of time. ]
Line 18, 19:19:11: Q. So you stopped seeing En because
Line 19, 19:19:11: you couldn't afford to see him?
Line 20, 19:19:11: A. I couldn't afford to see him, correct.
Line 21, 19:19:11: Q. Well, could you afford to see Qa
Line 22, 19:19:11: A. No, I could not.

Line 5, 19:19:11: A. That's when I had called Ron and told him
Line 6, 19:19:11: I couldn't afford to see a doctor because of the
Line 7, 19:19:11: fact of how much it was costing me, so he wanted me
Line 8, 19:19:11: to sec QM sto see if we could work something
Line 9, 19:19:11: out with them, and they work the same way. I would
Line 10, 19:19:11: still have to pay the deductible.
Line 11, 19:19:11: MR. MILLER: Right, which was sent there
Line 12, 19:19:11: because she's not paying a co-pay there in the
Line 13, 19:19:11: same way.
Line 14, 19:19:11: A. Right.
Line 15, 19:19:11: Q. So when did you start seeing ay

Line 18, 19:19:11: Q. I'm sorry. Go ahead. Go ahead.
Line 19, 19:19:11: A. Okay. And then a couple weeks ago, that's
Line 20, 19:19:11: when I started with the pain in here, and that's
Line 21, 19:19:11: when I called Johns Hopkins to talk to FP
Line 22, 19:19:11: about making an appointment and they told me he was
Line 23, 19:19:11: no longer there.

Line 8, 19:19:15: fall back on and nobody to pay the $30 every time I

Line 7, 16:09:03: A. Okay.
Line 8, 16:09:03: Q. I'm going to ask you some questions about /
Line 9, 16:09:03: your background, about the accident and about your
Line 10, 16:09:03: injuries.
Line 11, 16:09:03: A. Okay.

Line 13, 16:09:03: I'm here to get information, so if I ask you

Line 17, 16:09:03: A. Definitely.
Line 18, 16:09:03: Q. Is it fair for me to assume that if I ask

Line 20, 16:09:03: SS ee
Line 21, 16:09:03: what I asked you?
Line 22, 16:09:03: A. Yes, sir.
Line 23, 16:09:03: Q. Okay. It's very important we don't both
Line 24, 16:09:03: speak at the same time. The court reporter can go
Line 25, 16:09:03: fairly quickly, but she cannot take down two people
Line 26, 16:09:03: talking at once. She can only record one thread of

Line 8, 16:09:03: Q. And that will also ensure that you've

Line 10, 16:09:03: A. Yes, sir.
Line 11, 16:09:03: Q. Okay. And the same way, except for you
Line 12, 16:09:03: to, I heard you say what day the accident was, I've
Line 13, 16:09:03: never spoken to you before, and so I don't know your
Line 14, 16:09:03: pattern of speech. You may be thinking of some more
Line 15, 16:09:03: information you want to share to answer a question,
Line 16, 16:09:03: but I may think you're completed. I never intend to
Line 17, 16:09:03: interrupt you. If I've interrupted you and you have
Line 18, 16:09:03: not given me the complete answer, will you ask me to
Line 19, 16:09:03: let you finish the answer?
Line 20, 16:09:03: A. Yes, sir.
Line 21, 16:09:03: Q. I can ask you a lot of questions, and the
Line 22, 16:09:03: more I ask, the more detailed I get, and at some

Line 23, 16:09:03: perjury, and you understand what that means?
Line 24, 16:09:03: A. Yes, I do, sir.

Line 4, 16:09:07: but for some reason, the past couple days, they've i
Line 5, 16:09:07: been doing a lot of construction work, so I decided,
Line 6, 16:09:07: you know, I used to take that route along -- a lot,
Line 7, 16:09:07: so I figured I'd just go back to the same route
Line 8, 16:09:07: again, so I was going down east to North Point Road
Line 9, 16:09:07: to I guess it's a cut off after Quad Avenue, and
Line 10, 16:09:07: that takes me onto Pulaski. :
Line 11, 16:09:07: Q. So you're on North Point Road, and if the :
Line 12, 16:09:07: accident wouldn't have happened, you would have gone
Line 13, 16:09:07: past Quad?
Line 14, 16:09:07: A. Correct.
Line 15, 16:09:07: Q. And you would have turned in what
Line 16, 16:09:07: direction?
Line 17, 16:09:07: A. I guess it would be going maybe west.
Line 18, 16:09:07: I meant right or left.
Line 19, 16:09:07: Oh, I'm sorry. Right.
Line 20, 16:09:07: Right, onto?
Line 21, 16:09:07: Onto Pulaski Highway.
Line 22, 16:09:07: Q. And then from Pulaski Highway, you take
Line 23, 16:09:07: that all the way out to --
Line 24, 16:09:07: A. Yes, about a half a mile to where it takes

Line 3, 16:09:07: Page 12
Line 4, 16:09:07: me to 67th Street.
Line 5, 16:09:07: Q. Okay. The road you were on where the
Line 6, 16:09:07: accident happened is called what?
Line 7, 16:09:07: A. That is North Point Road.
Line 8, 16:09:07: Q. Okay. How long had you been on North :
Line 9, 16:09:07: Point Road before the area where the accident
Line 10, 16:09:07: occurred, how far?
Line 11, 16:09:07: A. From Edgemere, coming out of Edgemere,
Line 12, 16:09:07: about 12 1/2 miles.
Line 13, 16:09:07: Q. So you'd been on North Point Road for
Line 14, 16:09:07: 1/2 miles? 4
Line 15, 16:09:07: A. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. /
Line 16, 16:09:07: Q. And as you're approaching the area where
Line 17, 16:09:07: the accident happened, describe North Point Road to
Line 18, 16:09:07: me, how many lanes and that sort of thing. ‘
Line 19, 16:09:07: A. Going down North Point all the way from
Line 20, 16:09:07: Edgemere, it's two lanes all the way in. Once you
Line 21, 16:09:07: hit Kane, I guess it goes to Kane Street, the
Line 22, 16:09:07: intersection there. If you're coming down, it goes
Line 23, 16:09:07: down to two until you hit the underpass, and then it
Line 24, 16:09:07: SSS
Line 25, 16:09:07: goes into three.
