Line 85, 16:06:24: A. Okay.

Line 87, 16:06:24: your background, about the accident and about your

Line 99, 16:06:24: what I asked you?
Line 100, 16:06:24: A. Yes, sir.
Line 101, 16:06:24: Q. Okay. It's very important we don't both
Line 102, 16:06:24: speak at the same time. The court reporter can go
Line 103, 16:06:24: fairly quickly, but she cannot take down two people
Line 104, 16:06:24: talking at once. She can only record one thread of

Line 116, 16:06:24: A. Yes, sir.
Line 117, 16:06:24: Q. Okay. And the same way, except for you
Line 118, 16:06:24: to, I heard you say what day the accident was, I've
Line 119, 16:06:24: never spoken to you before, and so I don't know your

Line 121, 16:06:24: information you want to share to answer a question,
Line 122, 16:06:24: but I may think you're completed. I never intend to

Line 272, 16:06:31: but for some reason, the past couple days, they've i
Line 273, 16:06:31: been doing a lot of construction work, so I decided,
Line 274, 16:06:31: you know, I used to take that route along -- a lot,
Line 275, 16:06:31: so I figured I'd just go back to the same route
Line 276, 16:06:31: again, so I was going down east to North Point Road
Line 277, 16:06:31: to I guess it's a cut off after Quad Avenue, and
Line 278, 16:06:31: that takes me onto Pulaski. :
Line 279, 16:06:31: Q. So you're on North Point Road, and if the :
Line 280, 16:06:31: accident wouldn't have happened, you would have gone
Line 281, 16:06:31: past Quad?
Line 282, 16:06:31: A. Correct.
Line 283, 16:06:31: Q. And you would have turned in what
Line 284, 16:06:31: direction?
Line 285, 16:06:31: A. I guess it would be going maybe west.
Line 286, 16:06:31: I meant right or left.
Line 287, 16:06:31: Oh, I'm sorry. Right.
Line 288, 16:06:31: Right, onto?
Line 289, 16:06:31: Onto Pulaski Highway.
Line 290, 16:06:31: Q. And then from Pulaski Highway, you take

Line 310, 16:06:31: A. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. /
Line 311, 16:06:31: Q. And as you're approaching the area where
Line 312, 16:06:31: the accident happened, describe North Point Road to
Line 313, 16:06:31: me, how many lanes and that sort of thing. ‘
Line 314, 16:06:31: A. Going down North Point all the way from
Line 315, 16:06:31: Edgemere, it's two lanes all the way in. Once you
Line 316, 16:06:31: hit Kane, I guess it goes to Kane Street, the
Line 317, 16:06:31: intersection there. If you're coming down, it goes
Line 318, 16:06:31: down to two until you hit the underpass, and then it
Line 319, 16:06:31: SSS
Line 320, 16:06:31: goes into three.

Line 353, 16:06:35: where was it?
Line 354, 16:06:35: A. He was in the righthand lane, and I was in :
Line 355, 16:06:35: the left lane coming down North Point.
Line 356, 16:06:35: Q. And when you first saw the truck, where

Line 367, 16:06:35: he got into the lane splits out where it comes down
Line 368, 16:06:35: the three lanes. I put my blinker on. I went into
Line 369, 16:06:35: the right lane. He went into the very center lane, |
Line 370, 16:06:35: and then we were following each other all the way
Line 371, 16:06:35: down about, I guess about a quarter of a mile before

Line 380, 16:06:35: right?
Line 381, 16:06:35: A. Okay. I'm in the right lane, he's in the

Line 383, 16:06:35: Q. Oh, I misunderstood you.
Line 384, 16:06:35: A. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. My right and left.
Line 385, 16:06:35: MR. MILLER: I thought he had it right,
Line 386, 16:06:35: actually. I could be wrong. P
Line 387, 16:06:35: A. No, as we were coming down, I was in the
Line 388, 16:06:35: righthand lane, he was in the left lane as we were
Line 389, 16:06:35: coming down underneath the underpass.
Line 390, 16:06:35: Q. Okay. i

Line 405, 16:06:35: get it right. So when it was two lanes, the truck
Line 406, 16:06:35: is in the left?
Line 407, 16:06:35: A. Correct.
Line 408, 16:06:35: Q. And you were to the truck's right?
Line 409, 16:06:35: A. In the right.
Line 410, 16:06:35: Q. Now, when a third lane is created, does
Line 411, 16:06:35: that appear on the righthand side --
Line 412, 16:06:35: A. Yes, it does.
Line 413, 16:06:35: Q. -- or on the lefthand side? The right?

Line 417, 16:06:35: did I understand that you moved over one lane to the

Line 419, 16:06:35: A. Yes, I did.
Line 420, 16:06:35: QO. And the truck moved over one lane so it's
Line 421, 16:06:35: in the second lane from the right?
Line 422, 16:06:35: A. Correct.
Line 423, 16:06:35: Q. Okay. And as you're driving along North

Line 432, 16:06:39: A. His truck was here, and I was right behind
Line 433, 16:06:39: his door --
Line 434, 16:06:39: Q. You need to -- let me interrupt you. You
Line 435, 16:06:39: need to use words like behind his door. That's
Line 436, 16:06:39: good. Here doesn't work because they can only take
Line 437, 16:06:39: down what you say.
Line 438, 16:06:39: A. I know.
Line 439, 16:06:39: Q. So you need to describe it in words.
Line 440, 16:06:39: A. We were going eastbound. The tractor
Line 441, 16:06:39: trailer was in the left lane, I was in the right :
Line 442, 16:06:39: lane and I was adjacent to his door.
Line 443, 16:06:39: Q. The door?
Line 444, 16:06:39: A. The back side of his door, of the tractor
Line 445, 16:06:39: trailer, because I remember looking over. We
Line 446, 16:06:39: weren't going fast at all. I remember looking over f[
Line 447, 16:06:39: and seeing the numbers that was on the side of the i
Line 448, 16:06:39: door because I felt -- I never seen a truck that big |

Line 457, 16:06:39: A. It only had a couple pallets on it, and I
Line 458, 16:06:39: thought it was kind of a big truck for being in such
Line 459, 16:06:39: a little area, that little area of road.
Line 460, 16:06:39: Q. What kind of trailer was attached to the
Line 461, 16:06:39: tractor?
Line 462, 16:06:39: A. It was a big trailer. ;
Line 463, 16:06:39: Q. Well, in other words, there's the box
Line 464, 16:06:39: trailer that has walls and so forth --
Line 465, 16:06:39: A. No, it was a open trailer. It was a open
Line 466, 16:06:39: trailer, and I just remember looking over and seeing [|
Line 467, 16:06:39: that, you know, because I was right beside him.
Line 468, 16:06:39: Q. An open trailer is what people sometimes

Line 471, 16:06:39: Q. -- a bed and you see the product sitting :
Line 472, 16:06:39: on there, and you're saying there weren't many of :
Line 473, 16:06:39: them?
Line 474, 16:06:39: A. Didn't look there was many of them. It
Line 475, 16:06:39: was a couple pallets, and I didn't know what was in

Line 482, 16:06:39: 1 Q. Okay. So as you're driving along, before
Line 483, 16:06:39: the lane split, before we add the lane to the right,
Line 484, 16:06:39: you're in the right lane, the truck's in the left,
Line 485, 16:06:39: and your, the front of your -- what are you driving?
Line 486, 16:06:39: A green pickup, right?
Line 487, 16:06:39: 6 A. I have a very big truck. I have a truck,
Line 488, 16:06:39: a Dodge Daytona -- a Dodge Dakota.
Line 489, 16:06:39: 8 Q. Okay. And that's lined up, the front of
Line 490, 16:06:39: your pickup is, is alongside --

Line 496, 16:06:39: 16 A. My, my front of my truck was in like the
Line 497, 16:06:39: middle of his door to the end of his door where you
Line 498, 16:06:39: open it up.
Line 499, 16:06:39: 19 Q. Okay. And then a lane is added on the

Line 508, 16:06:39: Q. And then what did you do? Did you move q
Line 509, 16:06:39: into the right lane?
Line 510, 16:06:39: A. Yes. I put my blinker on and I moved into
Line 511, 16:06:39: the right lane because that exit, that lane takes me
Line 512, 16:06:39: to my exit.
Line 513, 16:06:39: Q. Okay. And did the truck put its right
Line 514, 16:06:39: turn signal on and move into the lane that you had
Line 515, 16:06:39: previously --
Line 516, 16:06:39: A. No, he did not.
Line 517, 16:06:39: Okay. What did the truck do next?
Line 518, 16:06:39: A. He just basically had gotten into that
Line 519, 16:06:39: lane when I moved over. He had gotten into that
Line 520, 16:06:39: lane, and I moved over into my lane.
Line 521, 16:06:39: Q. Okay. Were you and the truck going
Line 522, 16:06:39: approximately the same speed, or is one of you going
Line 523, 16:06:39: faster than the other?
Line 524, 16:06:39: A. Probably exactly the same, because we were
Line 525, 16:06:39: staying up at the same pace all the way down.
Line 526, 16:06:39: Q. And what speed was that?
Line 527, 16:06:39: A. I'd say no more than 15, 20 miles, because

Line 536, 16:06:43: up to I guess where he was making a turn, and alls I
Line 537, 16:06:43: know is I was just going down. I put my blinker on
Line 538, 16:06:43: to make the turn because it's at the next light.
Line 539, 16:06:43: Went to put my blinker on to make that turn, and all
Line 540, 16:06:43: of a sudden, he was in front of me. His truck just
Line 541, 16:06:43: came completely in front of me, and T went
Line 542, 16:06:43: underneath the back end of his front tire.

Line 590, 16:06:43: the pictures that you could point out to me? :
Line 591, 16:06:43: A. No, that's it. There was some damage done
Line 592, 16:06:43: to the motor of the car, I think, because I had to
Line 593, 16:06:43: take it back to Thompson Dodge because it was doing
Line 594, 16:06:43: so much rattling, and they had to do something to
Line 595, 16:06:43: the steering.
Line 596, 16:06:43: Q. Okay. So the two of you were going
Line 597, 16:06:43: alongside of each other on North Point for a period
Line 598, 16:06:43: of time at about the same speed, and did you ever
Line 599, 16:06:43: see a turn signal on the truck?
Line 600, 16:06:43: A. No, sir, I did not.
Line 601, 16:06:43: Q. Can you describe to me the angle of the
Line 602, 16:06:43: tractor when it hit you? Do you know what I mean?
Line 603, 16:06:43: Was it sort of side to side or the tractor turned
Line 604, 16:06:43: 90 degrees?
Line 605, 16:06:43: A. He didn't turn because I figured I
Line 606, 16:06:43: probably would have seen if he would have went out

Line 612, 16:06:43: of the lines, because I mean, the road is very small }
Line 613, 16:06:43: on that side. On the right side, the lane is a real
Line 614, 16:06:43: small lane. I mean, that tractor trailer was big.
Line 615, 16:06:43: If I would have seen him turn or even be in the
Line 616, 16:06:43: middle of any of the lanes, I would have seen that
Line 617, 16:06:43: compared to my truck, I would have seen him pull
Line 618, 16:06:43: away from my truck. The front of the truck would
Line 619, 16:06:43: have pulled away from my truck instead of being so
Line 620, 16:06:43: close to my truck.

Line 623, 16:06:43: Q. Let me show you the police report for the
Line 624, 16:06:43: accident --
Line 625, 16:06:43: A. sure.
Line 626, 16:06:43: Q. -- which we've marked as Exhibit 4. The
Line 627, 16:06:43: police officer wasn't there, so he didn't see the
Line 628, 16:06:43: accident, but he drew a diagram.
Line 629, 16:06:43: A. Uh-huh.
Line 630, 16:06:43: Q. Does that diagram to your way of thinking
Line 631, 16:06:43: accurately show the angle of the tractor in relation |
Line 632, 16:06:43: to the angle of your pickup?

Line 638, 16:06:46: A. Yes, it does, because his whole trailer
Line 639, 16:06:46: was in his lane, and that lane, it was not over in
Line 640, 16:06:46: any of the lanes.
Line 641, 16:06:46: Q. Okay. And the front of the tractor had :
Line 642, 16:06:46: turned close to 90 degrees towards your truck?
Line 643, 16:06:46: A. Correct.
Line 644, 16:06:46: Q. So in other words, trying to perceive what
Line 645, 16:06:46: happened, it wasn't like the truck was sort of
Line 646, 16:06:46: sliding over to the right?
Line 647, 16:06:46: A. Right.
Line 648, 16:06:46: Q. It was like a sharp right turn?
Line 649, 16:06:46: A. Yeah.
Line 650, 16:06:46: Q. Okay. Describe to me the impact as you
Line 651, 16:06:46: experienced it.
Line 652, 16:06:46: A. It was a hard impact, very hard. I mean,
Line 653, 16:06:46: I, I hurt my hand. I mean, everything just -- my
Line 654, 16:06:46: hand just completely just went (indicating).
Line 655, 16:06:46: Severe, severe pain. There was a point where as
Line 656, 16:06:46: soon as the impact, I was crying because of the

Line 665, 16:06:46: Q. How did that happen; do you know?
Line 666, 16:06:46: A. I don't know. I mean, I was holding onto
Line 667, 16:06:46: the steering wheel, and I don't know what happened.
Line 668, 16:06:46: I mean, it just, the impact, because I mean, he just
Line 669, 16:06:46: came in over my, just came in front of me, and it
Line 670, 16:06:46: was like boom. There was no stopping. There was
Line 671, 16:06:46: nowhere I could just, just slam on the brakes or
Line 672, 16:06:46: anything. There was no -- it was there. It just
Line 673, 16:06:46: happened.

Line 675, 16:06:46: other than your left wrist and hand?
Line 676, 16:06:46: A. Just my back when I went backwards, other

Line 678, 16:06:46: Q. Do you have airbags on your pickup truck?
Line 679, 16:06:46: A. Yes, I do, on both sides.

Line 703, 16:06:46: out. I couldn't get out. I had my seat belt

Line 718, 16:06:46: 4 A. No, they opened up the door. No, they
Line 719, 16:06:46: So you would have been able to get out if

Line 768, 16:06:50: going only 15.
Line 769, 16:06:50: 6 A. Because we weren't going that fast beacuse
Line 770, 16:06:50: that road's not that -- that lane is not that wide.
Line 771, 16:06:50: It's not that wide at all, and tractor trailers, you

Line 905, 16:06:54: I was up in their office on Tuesday making future

Line 952, 16:06:58: A. I'm not exactly sure. q
Line 953, 16:06:58: Q. Okay. Sometime in January, did you see
Line 954, 16:06:58: A. Probably, yes. :
Line 955, 16:06:58: Q. Why did you --
Line 956, 16:06:58: A. I'm just estimating, because I had went in
Line 957, 16:06:58: for Qa, «GUERIN nad wanted me to see a
Line 958, 16:06:58: all> who specializes in pain management so
Line 959, 16:06:58: they could do some ganglion stellate blockages to :
Line 960, 16:06:58: stop the nerve endings from the pain that they were |
Line 961, 16:06:58: causing, and I had that done at Johns Hopkins on
Line 962, 16:06:58: December 7th.
Line 963, 16:06:58: Q. What did you have done at Johns Hopkins on
Line 964, 16:06:58: December 7th? '
Line 965, 16:06:58: A. It's called a stellate, S-T-E-L-L-A-G-E,
Line 966, 16:06:58: ganglion, G-A-L-L-I-O-N, blockage. That's where

Line 973, 16:06:58: nerves that go in through the arms underneath the
Line 974, 16:06:58: chest.
Line 975, 16:06:58: Q. And what's the purpose of that?
Line 976, 16:06:58: A. It deadens the nerves, because what
Line 977, 16:06:58: happens is when you have severe nerve damage, it's
Line 978, 16:06:58: like electrical impulses going off. It's like
Line 979, 16:06:58: taking a cord and fraying it and all the electrical ;
Line 980, 16:06:58: impulses going all over the place. That's what
Line 981, 16:06:58: causes the pain in the tissues, so what they do is :
Line 982, 16:06:58: they block it off so it doesn't go down that far.
Line 983, 16:06:58: It just leaves an even line. |
Line 984, 16:06:58: Q. Do you have the records of that procedure? :

Line 1001, 16:06:58: seeing as
Line 1002, 16:06:58: A. Because I didn't have any more money to --
Line 1003, 16:06:58: I kept paying for all the medical bills, and I'ma
Line 1004, 16:06:58: Single person. I can't afford to keep putting
Line 1005, 16:06:58: out -- it was costing me $30 to see him every time I
Line 1006, 16:06:58: seen him, and you know, my medical insurance will :
Line 1007, 16:06:58: only cover so much, and then after with physical
Line 1008, 16:06:58: therapy as well, my deductible, I had to pay my
Line 1009, 16:06:58: deductible in this, so every time I had to see him :
Line 1010, 16:06:58: thereafter, I couldn't afford it. They cut my hours

Line 1013, 16:06:58: Q. So you stopped seeing En because
Line 1014, 16:06:58: you couldn't afford to see him?
Line 1015, 16:06:58: A. I couldn't afford to see him, correct.

Line 1017, 16:06:58: A. No, I could not.

Line 1037, 16:06:58: A. That's when I had called Ron and told him
Line 1038, 16:06:58: I couldn't afford to see a doctor because of the
Line 1039, 16:06:58: fact of how much it was costing me, so he wanted me
Line 1040, 16:06:58: to sec QM sto see if we could work something
Line 1041, 16:06:58: out with them, and they work the same way. I would
Line 1042, 16:06:58: still have to pay the deductible.
Line 1043, 16:06:58: MR. MILLER: Right, which was sent there
Line 1044, 16:06:58: because she's not paying a co-pay there in the

Line 1046, 16:06:58: A. Right.
Line 1047, 16:06:58: Q. So when did you start seeing ay

Line 1050, 16:06:58: Q. I'm sorry. Go ahead. Go ahead.
Line 1051, 16:06:58: A. Okay. And then a couple weeks ago, that's
Line 1052, 16:06:58: when I started with the pain in here, and that's
Line 1053, 16:06:58: when I called Johns Hopkins to talk to FP
Line 1054, 16:06:58: about making an appointment and they told me he was
