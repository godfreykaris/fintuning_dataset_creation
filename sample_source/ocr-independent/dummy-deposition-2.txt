Line 1, 19:01:34: Deposition:
Line 2, 19:01:34: Please state your name for the record. Michael Anderson. And how do you spell your last name, Mr.
Line 3, 19:01:34: Anderson? A-N-D-E-R-S-O-N. Anderson, are you aware that today's proceedings are a legal deposition
Line 4, 19:01:34: and that you are under oath to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? Yes, I am
Line 5, 19:01:34: aware. Thank you. Mr. Anderson, were you employed by Acme Corporation from [Start Date] to [End
Line 6, 19:01:34: Date]? Yes, I was. I worked in the marketing department as a graphic designer. During your employment
Line 7, 19:01:34: with Acme, can you describe your job duties and responsibilities? I was responsible for developing and
Line 8, 19:01:34: designing various marketing materials such as brochures, advertisements, and product packaging. I also
Line 9, 19:01:34: assisted with website design and social media graphics. Throughout your employment at Acme, did you
Line 10, 19:01:34: receive any performance reviews? Yes, I received annual reviews. All my reviews consistently rated me
Line 11, 19:01:34: as "meeting expectations" or exceeding expectations in certain areas. Did you ever receive any
Line 12, 19:01:34: disciplinary actions or warnings during your employment with Acme? No, I never did. Mr. Anderson,
Line 13, 19:01:34: during your time at Acme, did you witness or experience any situations that you felt could be considered
Line 14, 19:01:34: discriminatory based on your [Protected category, e.g., age, race, gender]?
Line 15, 19:01:34: Summary:
Line 16, 19:01:34: The excerpt is from a legal deposition of Michael Anderson, who is under oath to tell the truth. Mr.
Line 17, 19:01:34: Anderson confirms his employment at Acme Corporation as a graphic designer and details his job duties.
Line 18, 19:01:34: He also confirms receiving positive performance reviews and never facing disciplinary actions. The
Line 19, 19:01:34: excerpt ends with a question about witnessing or experiencing any discriminatory situations at Acme.

Line 1, 19:01:34: Deposition:
Line 2, 19:01:34: Objection, that question calls for legal conclusions from the witness. Withdrawn. Mr. Anderson, please
Line 3, 19:01:34: describe any specific incidents or instances at Acme that involved your [protected category]. There were
Line 4, 19:01:34: several things that made me feel uncomfortable. During meetings, colleagues often talked over me or
Line 5, 19:01:34: dismissed my ideas, particularly when compared to my younger male colleagues. I was also consistently
Line 6, 19:01:34: passed over for promotions despite having experience and qualifications comparable to others who got
Line 7, 19:01:34: promoted. Mr. Anderson, can you be specific about which colleagues treated you this way and provide
Line 8, 19:01:34: specific examples of situations where these incidents occurred? One specific example would be the
Line 9, 19:01:34: marketing campaign for the new product launch in 2023. I put significant effort into developing design
Line 10, 19:01:34: concepts, but they were ultimately disregarded without any explanation. My male colleague's design,
Line 11, 19:01:34: which was very similar to mine, was ultimately chosen. Did you ever report any of these incidents to
Line 12, 19:01:34: your supervisor or anyone else at Acme? I once mentioned feeling undervalued to my supervisor, but
Line 13, 19:01:34: they brushed it off, suggesting I needed to "work harder to prove myself." I wasn't comfortable bringing
Line 14, 19:01:34: it up further after that. Did you decide to leave Acme voluntarily, or were you terminated? When they
Line 15, 19:01:34: announced another promotion I felt qualified for, but was once again passed over without explanation, I
Line 16, 19:01:34: decided it was time to find a new position where I felt valued and respected. Mr. Anderson, can you
Line 17, 19:01:34: confirm that your decision to leave Acme was solely based on not receiving the promotion, and not due
Line 18, 19:01:34: to other factors like job performance or personal reasons? To the best of my knowledge, yes. It became
Line 19, 19:01:34: clear to me that further advancement opportunities within the company were unlikely. That's all my
Line 20, 19:01:34: questions at this time. Mr. Anderson, during your time at Acme, did you ever receive any negative
Line 21, 19:01:34: performance reviews or warnings related to your work performance? No, as mentioned before, my
Line 22, 19:01:34: performance reviews were always positive. Did you ever attend any diversity and inclusion training
Line 23, 19:01:34: offered by Acme during your employment? I did participate in the mandatory online training modules,
Line 24, 19:01:34: but there weren't any specific training sessions related to addressing or reporting potentially
Line 25, 19:01:34: discriminatory situations within the company.
Line 26, 19:01:34: Summary
Line 27, 19:01:34: The follow-up questioning delves deeper into Mr. Anderson's experiences at Acme. He details specific
Line 28, 19:01:34: examples of feeling sidelined and undervalued, particularly compared to younger male colleagues. He
Line 29, 19:01:34: mentions the disregarded product launch design concept and instances of being passed over for
Line 30, 19:01:34: promotions despite his qualifications. While not explicitly stating "discrimination," he highlights feeling
Line 31, 19:01:34: uncomfortable and unappreciated. When pressed for specific actions taken, he mentions mentioning his
Line 32, 19:01:34: feelings to a supervisor who dismissed them. He refrained from further complaints due to discomfort.
Line 33, 19:01:34: He clarifies that his decision to leave stemmed from the lack of advancement opportunities and feeling
Line 34, 19:01:34: undervalued, not performance issues or personal reasons. He reiterates his positive performance
Line 35, 19:01:34: reviews and confirms attending mandatory online diversity training, but mentions a lack of specific
Line 36, 19:01:34: training related to addressing potential discrimination.
Line 37, 19:01:34: Deposition:
Line 38, 19:01:34: Mr. Anderson, are you aware of Acme's anti-discrimination policy or how complaints of discrimination
Line 39, 19:01:34: are addressed within the company? I reviewed the employee handbook, which did explain the existence
Line 40, 19:01:34: of an anti-discrimination policy. However, I was unsure of the specific complaint process at the time. Mr.
Line 41, 19:01:34: Anderson, can you elaborate on why you felt apprehensive about bringing up these incidents to your
Line 42, 19:01:34: supervisor despite feeling uncomfortable and undervalued? Honestly, there were a few reasons. Firstly,
--- End of Page 2 ---

--- Beginning of Page 3 ---
Line 1, 19:01:34: as I mentioned, when I did hint at feeling undervalued to my supervisor, their dismissive response
Line 2, 19:01:34: discouraged me from further discussions. It seemed like they weren't receptive to hearing about any
Line 3, 19:01:34: potential issues. Secondly, there was a general company culture that made me hesitant to speak up.
Line 4, 19:01:34: Younger male colleagues often dominated conversations and presentations, and there weren't many
Line 5, 19:01:34: women in senior positions within the marketing department. It felt like my voice wouldn't be heard or
Line 6, 19:01:34: even worse, that bringing forward complaints might lead to retaliation or hinder my career further. Did
Line 7, 19:01:34: you notice any specific instances of retaliation against other employees who may have raised complaints
Line 8, 19:01:34: or concerns about work environment issues? While I can't say for sure, there was one colleague, Sarah
Line 9, 19:01:34: Lopez, who openly challenged gender bias during a department meeting but was subsequently given
Line 10, 19:01:34: less desirable project assignments compared to her male colleagues. This incident definitely reinforced
Line 11, 19:01:34: my concerns about potentially facing a similar situation. Objection, speculation about an unrelated case
Line 12, 19:01:34: is irrelevant to the present matter. Withdrawn. Mr. Anderson, did you ever discuss your concerns about
Line 13, 19:01:34: potential bias or lack of promotion opportunities with any human resources personnel at Acme? No, I
Line 14, 19:01:34: didn't. As I mentioned before, the lack of clarity on the specific complaint process combined with the
Line 15, 19:01:34: overall culture discouraged me from pursuing that route. Mr. Anderson, since leaving Acme, have you
Line 16, 19:01:34: sought employment elsewhere? Yes, I am currently employed at a different company and feel much
Line 17, 19:01:34: more valued and respected in my current role. The work environment is significantly more inclusive, and
Line 18, 19:01:34: I regularly receive positive feedback and opportunities for professional development. Mr. Anderson,
Line 19, 19:01:34: how has your experience at Acme impacted you personally and professionally? It was definitely a
Line 20, 19:01:34: frustrating and discouraging experience. It felt like my hard work and qualifications weren't being
Line 21, 19:01:34: recognized fairly, leading to some self-doubt and a sense of being undervalued. However, finding a new
Line 22, 19:01:34: and positive work environment has helped me rebuild my confidence and refocus on my career goals. I
Line 23, 19:01:34: have no further questions.
Line 24, 19:01:34: Summary
Line 25, 19:01:34: In an exit interview, Mr. Anderson explains his decision to leave Acme Corporation. He felt discouraged
Line 26, 19:01:34: by his supervisor's dismissal of his concerns and the company culture, which he perceived as
Line 27, 19:01:34: unreceptive and potentially punitive. He mentions a colleague, Sarah Lopez, who he believes faced
Line 28, 19:01:34: consequences for speaking up. Although he didn't formally file a complaint, he emphasizes the unclear
Line 29, 19:01:34: process and the unwelcoming company environment. Finally, Mr. Anderson confirms his new job and
Line 30, 19:01:34: highlights its positive aspects, contrasting them with his experience at Acme. He acknowledges the initial
Line 31, 19:01:34: negative impact of his time at Acme, including frustration and self-doubt, but emphasizes that his
Line 32, 19:01:34: current position has helped him regain confidence and refocus his career goals.
Line 33, 19:01:34: Deposition
Line 34, 19:01:34: I have one final question. Mr. Anderson, is there anything else you would like to add regarding your
Line 35, 19:01:34: experience at Acme Corporation? Just that I hope by sharing my story, it can contribute to fostering a
Line 36, 19:01:34: more diverse and inclusive work environment at Acme for future employees. Everyone deserves to feel
Line 37, 19:01:34: valued and respected in their workplace, regardless of their [protected category]. Interesting point, Mr.
Line 38, 19:01:34: Anderson. Ms. Garcia, while you have no further questions, I'd like to explore some aspects of Mr.
Line 39, 19:01:34: Anderson's experience further before concluding the deposition. No objection. Please proceed, Mr.
Line 40, 19:01:34: Thompson. Mr. Anderson, you mentioned feeling unsure about the specific complaint process at Acme.
Line 41, 19:01:34: Did you take any steps to learn more about it after your meeting with your supervisor? No, I didn't feel
Line 42, 19:01:34: comfortable approaching my supervisor again after their dismissive response. Additionally, I recall the
Line 43, 19:01:34: employee handbook being quite lengthy, and finding specific information about the complaint process
--- End of Page 3 ---

--- Beginning of Page 4 ---
Line 1, 19:01:34: proved difficult at the time. You mentioned a colleague, Sarah Lopez, who voiced concerns about gender
Line 2, 19:01:34: bias. Did you ever speak to her directly about her experience and the alleged retaliation she
Line 3, 19:01:34: faced? Briefly, yes. We expressed our mutual frustrations and the feeling of being undervalued within
Line 4, 19:01:34: the department. However, we were both hesitant to pursue any formal complaints due to the
Line 5, 19:01:34: aforementioned concerns about the company culture and potential retaliation. Did you ever discuss the
Line 6, 19:01:34: issue of lack of promotion opportunities with any other colleagues, particularly women in the marketing
Line 7, 19:01:34: department? Not directly. While there were a few women colleagues in the department, none of them
Line 8, 19:01:34: were in senior positions. The general environment discouraged open communication about potentially
Line 9, 19:01:34: sensitive topics like discrimination. Mr. Thompson, I object to leading the witness. Can you rephrase
Line 10, 19:01:34: your question and allow Mr. Anderson to answer in his own words? Apologies, Ms. Garcia. Mr.
Line 11, 19:01:34: Anderson, to clarify, did you have any informal conversations with other colleagues about your concerns
Line 12, 19:01:34: regarding promotion opportunities or potential gender bias within the marketing department at
Line 13, 19:01:34: Acme? There weren't any specific discussions about promotions or bias, but the general atmosphere
Line 14, 19:01:34: around the lack of female representation in senior positions was a frequent topic of quiet observation
Line 15, 19:01:34: amongst some female colleagues. We felt implicit pressure to work harder and prove ourselves more
Line 16, 19:01:34: than our male colleagues, but reaching leadership positions seemed like an increasingly distant
Line 17, 19:01:34: prospect. Mr. Anderson, can you elaborate on what kind of "pressure" you felt, and was there any
Line 18, 19:01:34: specific instance or behavior from colleagues or superiors that made you feel this way?
Line 19, 19:01:34: Summary
Line 20, 19:01:34: Mr. Anderson is wrapping up his deposition. He expresses hope that his story will contribute to a more
Line 21, 19:01:34: positive and inclusive work environment at Acme for future employees. The interviewer, Mr. Thompson,
Line 22, 19:01:34: has some additional questions. He asks Mr. Anderson about the complaint process at Acme and whether
Line 23, 19:01:34: he tried to learn more about it after his supervisor dismissed his concerns. Mr. Anderson admits he felt
Line 24, 19:01:34: uncomfortable going back to his supervisor and the employee handbook was difficult to navigate. The
Line 25, 19:01:34: conversation then turns to Sarah Lopez, a colleague who mentioned experiencing gender bias. Mr.
Line 26, 19:01:34: Anderson confirms having a brief conversation with her where they shared frustrations and felt
Line 27, 19:01:34: undervalued. However, both were hesitant to file formal complaints due to concerns about the
Line 28, 19:01:34: workplace culture. Mr. Thompson then asks about discussions regarding lack of promotion opportunities
Line 29, 19:01:34: for women. Mr. Anderson clarifies that while there weren't specific discussions, the lack of women in
Line 30, 19:01:34: senior positions and the overall environment discouraged open communication about sensitive topics
Line 31, 19:01:34: like gender bias. He describes a feeling of implicit pressure to outperform male colleagues, but achieving
Line 32, 19:01:34: leadership positions seemed unlikely. Finally, Mr. Thompson asks Mr. Anderson to elaborate on the
Line 33, 19:01:34: pressure he felt. Mr. Anderson is asked to provide specific examples, and the excerpt ends there.
Line 34, 19:01:34: Deposition
Line 35, 19:01:34: It wasn't any direct confrontation or statement, but more of a subtle feeling arising from observing the
Line 36, 19:01:34: lack of female representation in leadership roles combined with certain comments about needing to
Line 37, 19:01:34: "work harder" or "prove myself" despite my consistent positive performance reviews. Thank you, Mr.
Line 38, 19:01:34: Anderson. These are valuable insights. Do you have any further questions, Ms. Garcia? (after reviewing
Line 39, 19:01:34: her notes) I have a few follow-up questions for clarification. However, due to the time constraints, I
Line 40, 19:01:34: would like to schedule a follow-up session at your earliest convenience, Mr. Thompson, to continue
Line 41, 19:01:34: exploring specific details and potential evidence. No objection. Mr. Anderson, are you available for a
Line 42, 19:01:34: follow-up session within the next week? Yes, I am available. Please let me know the details when you've
--- End of Page 4 ---

--- Beginning of Page 5 ---
Line 1, 19:01:35: scheduled it Mr. Anderson, since our last session, have you had any time to review Acme Corporation's
Line 2, 19:01:35: employee handbook pertaining to the complaint process for potential discrimination? Yes, I have. Can
Line 3, 19:01:35: you briefly describe the steps outlined in the handbook for filing a complaint based on potential
Line 4, 19:01:35: discrimination? The handbook mentioned employees could submit a written complaint to the Human
Line 5, 19:01:35: Resources department or verbally report it to an HR representative or any manager. However, specific
Line 6, 19:01:35: details about the investigation process or resolution options were quite vague. Mr. Anderson, did the
Line 7, 19:01:35: employee handbook specify who constitutes a "manager" authorized to receive such initial verbal
Line 8, 19:01:35: complaints? No, it didn't provide any specific details about which managers were included in that
Line 9, 19:01:35: definition or if all managers were authorized to receive such reports. Mr. Anderson, you previously
Line 10, 19:01:35: mentioned frustration with receiving similar design concepts to yours being chosen over your own work
Line 11, 19:01:35: while working at Acme. Do you still have copies of these original design concepts and the final versions
Line 12, 19:01:35: ultimately used? Unfortunately, I didn't retain individual copies of every design iteration. However, I did
Line 13, 19:01:35: maintain some preliminary sketches and digital drafts from several projects, including the one discussed
Line 14, 19:01:35: earlier related to the 2023 product launch campaign. Would you be willing to provide these materials as
Line 15, 19:01:35: potential evidence in this case? Yes, I can bring them to the next session. Mr. Anderson, are you aware
Line 16, 19:01:35: of other colleagues who may have retained copies of their rejected design projects or drafts during their
Line 17, 19:01:35: employment at Acme? I'm not certain, but I remember several colleagues raising concerns about the
Line 18, 19:01:35: inconsistent feedback and selection process for design concepts. It's possible some of them might have
Line 19, 19:01:35: kept records for their own reference. We will look into that possibility. Mr. Anderson, during your time
Line 20, 19:01:35: at Acme, did you ever meet or hear about any employees who filed official complaints based on
Line 21, 19:01:35: experiencing discrimination? Not officially. As mentioned earlier, there was an underlying lack of
Line 22, 19:01:35: transparency and open communication around potentially sensitive topics like discrimination.
Line 23, 19:01:35: Therefore, it was difficult to know for sure. Mr. Anderson, did you receive any additional training or
Line 24, 19:01:35: workshops related to diversity and inclusion since leaving Acme Corporation? Yes, my current employer
Line 25, 19:01:35: offers comprehensive training programs and workshops regarding diversity and inclusion as part of their
Line 26, 19:01:35: ongoing commitment to a fair and equitable work environment. Do you find these additional training
Line 27, 19:01:35: programs and the overall work environment at your current company to be beneficial compared to your
Line 28, 19:01:35: experience at Acme? Absolutely. The focus on creating a safe space for open communication, valuing
Line 29, 19:01:35: diverse perspectives, and providing equal opportunities for growth has been incredibly positive and
Line 30, 19:01:35: empowering. No further questions at this time. Mr. Anderson, as mentioned previously, we would like
Line 31, 19:01:35: you to bring copies of the design materials you retained for the next session. Additionally, I may reach
Line 32, 19:01:35: out to inquire about potential colleagues who might have kept similar records. Is that alright? That's
Line 33, 19:01:35: perfectly fine. Please let me know if you need anything else in the meantime. Mr. Anderson, one final
Line 34, 19:01:35: question before we adjourn. You mentioned feeling hesitant to bring up your concerns to your
Line 35, 19:01:35: supervisor after their dismissive response. Did their reaction specifically mention any consequences of
Line 36, 19:01:35: raising the potential bias issue? Not directly. There wasn't an explicit threat of any sort. However, their
Line 37, 19:01:35: dismissive tone and the implication that my concerns weren't valid created an atmosphere where I felt
Line 38, 19:01:35: further discussion would be futile and potentially disadvantageous. Objection, speculation about the
Line 39, 19:01:35: witness's interpretation of a supervisor's tone is not based on facts. Reframing, Mr. Anderson. How did
Line 40, 19:01:35: your supervisor's response make you feel about the potential consequences of reporting your
Line 41, 19:01:35: concerns? Their response discouraged me and made me feel unheard. It conveyed the impression that
Line 42, 19:01:35: my concerns about potential bias wouldn't be taken seriously and could potentially hinder my career
Line 43, 19:01:35: progression within the company.
--- End of Page 5 ---

--- Beginning of Page 6 ---
Line 1, 19:01:35: Summary
Line 2, 19:01:35: In a follow-up deposition, Mr. Anderson clarified details about the complaint process at Acme and
Line 3, 19:01:35: confirmed reviewing the employee handbook. He mentioned the process outlines submitting a written
Line 4, 19:01:35: complaint to HR or verbally reporting it to an HR representative or a manager, but lacking specifics
Line 5, 19:01:35: about investigations or resolutions. He couldn't recall specific details about managers authorized to
Line 6, 19:01:35: receive verbal reports. Mr. Anderson admitted not keeping all design iterations but having some
Line 7, 19:01:35: sketches and drafts from specific projects, including the 2023 product launch campaign, which he
Line 8, 19:01:35: offered as potential evidence. He suggested some colleagues might have retained similar records due to
Line 9, 19:01:35: shared concerns about the selection process. While not aware of official complaints, Mr. Anderson
Line 10, 19:01:35: confirmed a lack of transparency around discrimination at Acme. He contrasted his current work
Line 11, 19:01:35: environment which offers diversity and inclusion training and fosters open communication, creating a
Line 12, 19:01:35: more positive and empowering experience compared to Acme. The session ended with Mr. Anderson
Line 13, 19:01:35: agreeing to bring design materials and potentially connect the interviewer with colleagues who might
Line 14, 19:01:35: have kept similar records. He clarified that while his supervisor's response didn't explicitly mention
Line 15, 19:01:35: consequences, the dismissive tone discouraged him and made him feel unheard, implying potential
Line 16, 19:01:35: career repercussions for raising concerns about bias.
Line 17, 19:01:35: Deposition
Line 18, 19:01:35: Mr. Thompson, I believe we've covered the essential topics for today. However, as these are complex
Line 19, 19:01:35: claims, I would appreciate the opportunity to review the transcript and potentially ask further questions
Line 20, 19:01:35: at a future session, should any need arise. No objection. Mr. Anderson, as Ms. Garcia mentioned, we
Line 21, 19:01:35: appreciate your willingness to cooperate and provide additional materials. We will be in touch to
Line 22, 19:01:35: schedule a follow-up session if needed. Understood.
Line 23, 19:01:35: Summary
Line 24, 19:01:35: Both parties agreed to conclude the deposition. The interviewer, Mr. Thompson, expressed the
Line 25, 19:01:35: possibility of needing a follow-up session after reviewing the transcript and potentially having further
Line 26, 19:01:35: questions. Mr. Anderson acknowledged this and confirmed his availability if needed.
Line 27, 19:01:35: Deposition
Line 28, 19:01:35: A driver is obligated to pay attention to the road and yield to other drivers when required. Let me take
Line 29, 19:01:35: you back to what happened on April 20th, 2022. The Defendant, who was an attorney for the IRS, was
Line 30, 19:01:35: driving her usual route to work. She drove down Annapolis Road to take a left onto another road. (Could
Line 31, 19:01:35: we have the next slide, please?) She was driving down this road… can everyone see this? She stopped at
Line 32, 19:01:35: a light on a clear day. While stopped, she reached down to find her parking pass. May we
Line 33, 19:01:35: approach? Yes. BENCH CONFERENCE (Bench Conference begins – 10:26:39m.) (The parties approach the
Line 34, 19:01:35: bench for a discussion.) By court ruling, liability has been established. The focus of this case is only on
Line 35, 19:01:35: damages. I understand why we’re discussing these details, but it’s about damages. I’m setting the scene
Line 36, 19:01:35: for the accident because her damages are part of the accident narrative. We’re only discussing the fact
Line 37, 19:01:35: that an accident happened and a person was injured. The details about reaching and negligence seem to
Line 38, 19:01:35: be evidence of liability. I understand. It’s your opening statement, so I’ll give you some leeway. I’m just
Line 39, 19:01:35: providing context. I’ll be getting into the damages soon. Alright. (Bench Conference concluded –
--- End of Page 6 ---

--- Beginning of Page 7 ---
Line 1, 19:01:35: 10:27:32 m.) (The parties return to their places.) The Defendant heard a horn beep and took a left turn.
Line 2, 19:01:35: She didn’t see the Plaintiff, who had the right of way, coming from the opposite direction. Due to the
Line 3, 19:01:35: collision, the Plaintiff’s ankle was broken and required surgery. Take a look at these images. The first one
Line 4, 19:01:35: shows her ankle before surgery, the second one after surgery. Today, she still has 15 screws and three
Line 5, 19:01:35: plates in her ankle. She will never be able to run again and standing for extended periods of time is
Line 6, 19:01:35: difficult. We’ve brought this case before you because of the harm caused to the Plaintiff. We needed to
Line 7, 19:01:35: agree that the Defendant was at fault for the accident, which she has accepted. We also had to
Line 8, 19:01:35: understand the extent and implications of the Plaintiff’s damages, not just the initial injury and surgery,
Line 9, 19:01:35: but also its long-term impact on her life. To do this, we spoke to her doctors, her husband, her friends,
Line 10, 19:01:35: and even her employer. One of her doctors is going to talk to you. This is the guy to see if something
Line 11, 19:01:35: awful like this is going to happen to your ankle. He received an Ivy League education and, at one point,
Line 12, 19:01:35: was the chief of foot and ankle orthopedic injuries at Johns Hopkins. He consults for the Baltimore
Line 13, 19:01:35: Orioles. His resume, I want to say, is as long as your arm, but it’s actually a lot longer than that. We’re
Line 14, 19:01:35: going to bring him to talk to you guys, in a very 2023 way. It’s going to be by videotape, so his testimony
Line 15, 19:01:35: will be by videotape, but it holds the same force as if it was at trial, and he came here to see us. And, of
Line 16, 19:01:35: course, my partner Laura Zois and the defense attorney had an opportunity to ask him questions. He’s
Line 17, 19:01:35: going to tell you she still has 15 screws and three plates in her ankle holding everything together. The
Line 18, 19:01:35: problem with that is that it creates a breeding ground for arthritis, and this 33-year-old woman already
Line 19, 19:01:35: has the signs of arthritis. At some point, she’s going to need what’s called a fusion, which will stabilize
Line 20, 19:01:35: her ankle. The bad news is, you can’t move it once it locks, so you no longer have the ability to
Line 21, 19:01:35: bend. This trial is about the harms and losses that she has suffered and endured as the result of this
Line 22, 19:01:35: accident. This is not a case about sympathy. You should not award her damages because you feel sorry
Line 23, 19:01:35: for her. You’re going to hear about how the accident has impacted her professional and personal life. At
Line 24, 19:01:35: the time of the crash, they were a very young family. They were an energetic family. This is an active
Line 25, 19:01:35: family with four kids doing everything you can imagine, Six Flags, the park. They would run together.
Line 26, 19:01:35: They played basketball together. They traveled everywhere, New York, Baltimore, Washington, DC. They
Line 27, 19:01:35: were just a very active family. And she also had a vibrant social life. She was a hairstylist, and she loved
Line 28, 19:01:35: that job. It was her social outlet beside her kids. She would do the church choir every Wednesday, and
Line 29, 19:01:35: still found times to go out and see her family. She’s still fighting with her family, but it’s hard. She can’t
Line 30, 19:01:35: work as a hairstylist anymore. So what did she do? She went back to school to the University of
Line 31, 19:01:35: Maryland. She’s working, getting very close to getting her degree. She’s still fighting. She has four kids
Line 32, 19:01:35: they’re chasing around. Let’s go back and talk about how it ended up. Let’s talk about the accident. She
Line 33, 19:01:35: had this awful crash and needed emergency surgery where they put in these screws. She had a nine-
Line 34, 19:01:35: month-old baby, along with three other kids. She and the two girls, the younger ones, went to live with
Line 35, 19:01:35: her mom. Her mom took care of her and the girls, while her husband took care of the other kids. This
Line 36, 19:01:35: has been a massive disruption to their lives. The accident has completely changed her life, and it’s
Line 37, 19:01:35: reflected in every facet of her day-to-day. Her job, her family life, her hobbies, everything she used to
Line 38, 19:01:35: take pleasure in has been impacted in one way or another. And the evidence in this case will show these
Line 39, 19:01:35: changes are likely to persist for the rest of her life. We ask you to consider the totality of these changes,
Line 40, 19:01:35: the persistent harm and loss she’s suffered and will continue to suffer, as a direct result of the accident.
Line 41, 19:01:35: We ask you to consider these when coming to a decision in this case. This accident, however, led to an
Line 42, 19:01:35: upheaval in their lives. About a month after the accident, she managed to return home with the kids.
Line 43, 19:01:35: Her mother, an FDA employee, took three months off work to care for her, her daughter, and her
Line 44, 19:01:35: grandchildren. The accident wreaked havoc on their lives. She endured six months of rigorous physical
--- End of Page 7 ---

--- Beginning of Page 8 ---
Line 1, 19:01:35: therapy and another operation. While it was painful and difficult, the effort was worthwhile as it
Line 2, 19:01:35: improved her condition, especially her ankle, though we wish she had recovered more. As we delve into
Line 3, 19:01:35: this case, it’s about the harm and losses experienced. We will ask you to make amends where possible
Line 4, 19:01:35: and provide compensation for the irreparable harm. The damages can be categorized into three parts:
Line 5, 19:01:35: her medical bills, the post-accident trauma suffered by her and her family, and the pain she will endure
Line 6, 19:01:35: for the expected next 45 years of her life. She was a spontaneous person, fond of making impromptu
Line 7, 19:01:35: plans like going to Virginia Beach over the weekend or heading to the park. Now, every activity revolves
Line 8, 19:01:35: around her ability to reach there, her mobility, and whether she can tolerate the pain during the trip.
Line 9, 19:01:35: This situation has affected her and her four kids, as well as her husband. The court wants to clarify that
Line 10, 19:01:35: the evidence and testimonies from the witness stand are what will control your deliberations. Opening
Line 11, 19:01:35: statements and closing arguments of lawyers do not constitute evidence. This case is not just about the
Line 12, 19:01:35: suffering of their children or her husband. It’s about the impact of their suffering on her. We will ask you
Line 13, 19:01:35: to consider an amount that may seem high at the beginning. But we believe that after hearing all the
Line 14, 19:01:35: evidence, you’ll find it to be a fair compensation for her losses and harm. The amount we suggest is $1.1
Line 15, 19:01:35: million. Defense Opening Statement Regarding the defendant, they acknowledge the responsibility for
Line 16, 19:01:35: the accident and that it was their fault. The case is for you to determine the appropriate damages. The
Line 17, 19:01:35: injury is severe, and they ask for an extraordinary amount of compensation. She broke her ankle, which
Line 18, 19:01:35: was repaired surgically with plates and screws. There was a second surgery due to loosening of the
Line 19, 19:01:35: screws, which were then removed. She attended physical therapy, which improved her ability to move
Line 20, 19:01:35: her ankle. Whether she will need surgery in the future is uncertain. The past medical expenses are
Line 21, 19:01:35: around $36,505, which we don’t contest. Her lost wages due to the accident are around $3,400 to
Line 22, 19:01:35: $3,500. These are not the focal points of this case. The main issue is the amount to be awarded for non-
Line 23, 19:01:35: economic damages, for which we request something fair, reasonable, and sensible. Thank you for your
Line 24, 19:01:35: time and attention, and we hope to conclude this case promptly. Testimony of Victim’s Husband Mr.
Line 25, 19:01:35: Good morning. Can I have your address? Certainly. Mr. How long have you lived at that address? I
Line 26, 19:01:35: bought the house in 2003, so it’s been approximately ten years. Mr. Who lives there with you? My
Line 27, 19:01:35: wife, and our four children. Mr. Can you tell the jury how old your children are and their names? Yes.
Line 28, 19:01:35: My children are 13, and the others are… The Honorable Please continue. …five, and three. Mr. I
Line 29, 19:01:35: understand. And for some background, what do you do for a living? I’m currently the general manager
Line 30, 19:01:35: at Oreck Clean Home Center. Mr. And where are these locations? We have six locations in Maryland
Line 31, 19:01:35: and Virginia. Mr. What are your responsibilities at work? I oversee all six stores and manage one of
Line 32, 19:01:35: them. Mr. Can you describe your work schedule? I work Monday through Saturday, from 10:00 am to
Line 33, 19:01:35: 7:00 pm. Often, I work seven days a week which means working on Sundays from 12:00 pm to 5:00
Line 34, 19:01:35: pm. Mr. How do you feel about those hours? They are long, but I need to work to support my
Line 35, 19:01:35: family. Mr. How long have you known your wife? I met her in 1993, she was my sister’s best friend. Mr.
Line 36, 19:01:35: You mean your wife was your sister’s best friend? Yes, I apologize for the confusion. She was indeed my
Line 37, 19:01:35: sister’s best friend. Mr. Let’s move to another topic. Do you remember the car accident your wife was in
Line 38, 19:01:35: 2022? Yes, I do. Mr. Prior to the accident, can you describe your household? Our household was what I
Line 39, 19:01:35: would consider the perfect life. My wife and children were happy and always engaged in activities. We
Line 40, 19:01:35: used to take vacations and attend family reunions. Mr. Was your wife a spontaneous person or a
Line 41, 19:01:35: planner? She was more spontaneous, always ready to take on new activities. Mr. Could you describe
Line 42, 19:01:35: her for the jury? She is always happy, loves socializing and helping people. She attended choir rehearsal,
Line 43, 19:01:35: Bible study every week, and also took care of our four children. Mr. What was her job at the time of the
Line 44, 19:01:35: crash? She was the assistant manager of a hair salon. Mr. Did she enjoy her work? Yes, she loved her
--- End of Page 8 ---

--- Beginning of Page 9 ---
Line 1, 19:01:35: work. It was part of her identity. Mr. Did your wife’s demeanor change after the car accident? Yes, after
Line 2, 19:01:35: the accident everything changed. Our family life and activity level changed significantly. She used to take
Line 3, 19:01:35: the children to sporting events and practice basketball. Now, she can’t do these activities. She no longer
Line 4, 19:01:35: goes on family vacations. My two older sons call her “boring” now because of her reduced activity level.
Line 5, 19:01:35: The accident has restricted her capabilities and as a result, she can’t even do simple tasks like carrying
Line 6, 19:01:35: laundry baskets or standing up to cook. Our family life has changed drastically since the accident. Mr.
Line 7, 19:01:35: Has your wife gone back to work since the accident? She tried to help a friend out a couple of months
Line 8, 19:01:35: ago at her hair salon, but it ended with her in a lot of pain due to the swelling in her ankle. Mr. I have
Line 9, 19:01:35: here a picture you received from your wife. Is this the picture she sent you? Mr. Can you tell us how
Line 10, 19:01:35: your wife’s personal social life has been affected since the crash? Her social life has indeed changed
Line 11, 19:01:35: significantly. Before the accident, she would regularly go out with friends, engage in dancing, and other
Line 12, 19:01:35: social activities. However, the constant pain and discomfort after the crash have made such activities
Line 13, 19:01:35: impossible. Her social life is definitely not the same as before. Mr. You mentioned earlier about her job.
Line 14, 19:01:35: Was she able to resume work post the crash? She attempted to return to work, but the persistent pain
Line 15, 19:01:35: made it unmanageable, particularly the long-standing hours. Eventually, she was forced to leave her
Line 16, 19:01:35: job. Mr. How has this situation impacted your family’s finances? The impact has been substantial. She
Line 17, 19:01:35: held the position of an assistant manager at a hair salon, bringing in a significant income. Now, with my
Line 18, 19:01:35: single income, managing expenses for our four children and her medical bills has been strenuous. Mr.
Line 19, 19:01:35: Besides the financial struggle, can you share how your relationship with your wife has evolved post the
Line 20, 19:01:35: accident? Our relationship has undeniably been affected. She isn’t the same person she was before the
Line 21, 19:01:35: crash. Her constant pain and fatigue, coupled with frustration, have been hard on both of us. Mr. And
Line 22, 19:01:35: your children? How have they been coping with all these changes? Our children have had to make
Line 23, 19:01:35: significant adjustments. They miss the mother they had before the crash, not understanding why she
Line 24, 19:01:35: can’t engage in the activities she used to do with them. My older sons, in particular, have had to step up,
Line 25, 19:01:35: assisting more with household chores. It’s been a lot for them too. Mr. Finally, could you share your
Line 26, 19:01:35: hopes for your wife’s future? My biggest hope is for her to find relief from her pain and regain some
Line 27, 19:01:35: semblance of normalcy. She deserves to live her life, not just endure it. It’s challenging to see such a
Line 28, 19:01:35: wonderful person go through this. We are taking each day as it comes, hoping for a better
Line 29, 19:01:35: future. Defense Attorney Cross Examination of Victim’s Husband Regarding the foot stretching exercises,
Line 30, 19:01:35: you assist her with those? Yes, I do. Looking through her medical records, I noticed there’s mention of
Line 31, 19:01:35: an exercise bike at home. Do you have one? Indeed, we do have an exercise bike at home. Did she
Line 32, 19:01:35: frequently use the exercise bike, especially post-accident? Initially, during her therapy, they had her try
Line 33, 19:01:35: riding the exercise bike. Can you tell us what kind of exercises she did at home after the accident? She
Line 34, 19:01:35: was given a chart with exercises, and I’ve been helping her to flex her foot in both directions to try and
Line 35, 19:01:35: loosen it up. How long did this routine last? Actually, I still assist her with the foot exercises every
Line 36, 19:01:35: night. So you assist her based on the instructions from the chart? Not directly from the chart, but I’ve
Line 37, 19:01:35: learned the correct angles and try to flex her foot every night for her comfort and to aid her sleep. Does
Line 38, 19:01:35: she drive? Yes, she does. Prior to the accident, she was employed full time? Yes, that’s correct. The jury
Line 39, 19:01:35: was informed initially that she was also pursuing a degree? Yes, she was attending the University of
Line 40, 19:01:35: Maryland. Did she commute to the university? At certain points she did, but due to our four children,
Line 41, 19:01:35: she primarily takes her classes online now. How close is she to obtaining her degree? She’s expected to
Line 42, 19:01:35: graduate within the next year. Any redirect? Mr. No further questions, Your Honor. Thank you, sir, you
Line 43, 19:01:35: may step down. Proceed with your next witness. (Witness excused – 11:56:56 a.m.)

Line 1, 19:01:35: Summary
Line 2, 19:01:35: A woman is suing another driver, an attorney, for damages caused by a car accident. The defendant has
Line 3, 19:01:35: admitted fault, and the case revolves around the compensation the injured woman deserves. The
Line 4, 19:01:35: woman suffered a broken ankle requiring surgery and therapy. She still experiences pain and limited
Line 5, 19:01:35: mobility, impacting her daily life and activities. She had to quit her hairstyling job and is now pursuing a
Line 6, 19:01:35: degree to explore new career options. The accident also significantly affected her family life, including
Line 7, 19:01:35: her social life, ability to participate in activities with her children, and her relationship with her husband.
Line 8, 19:01:35: The woman seeks $1.1 million in compensation for her medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering,
Line 9, 19:01:35: and the long-term impact on her life. The defense acknowledges the severity of the injury but questions
Line 10, 19:01:35: the requested amount. They point out that the woman can still drive, is pursuing a degree, and hasn't
Line 11, 19:01:35: exhausted all treatments, like using an exercise bike at home. The case hinges on determining the extent
Line 12, 19:01:35: of the woman's long-term suffering and the impact on her life, balanced against the evidence presented
Line 13, 19:01:35: by the defense regarding her ongoing activities
