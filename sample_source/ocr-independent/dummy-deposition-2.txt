Line 1, 16:07:18: Deposition:
Line 2, 16:07:18: Please state your name for the record. Michael Anderson. And how do you spell your last name, Mr.
Line 3, 16:07:18: Anderson? A-N-D-E-R-S-O-N. Anderson, are you aware that today's proceedings are a legal deposition
Line 4, 16:07:18: and that you are under oath to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? Yes, I am
Line 5, 16:07:18: aware. Thank you. Mr. Anderson, were you employed by Acme Corporation from [Start Date] to [End
Line 6, 16:07:18: Date]? Yes, I was. I worked in the marketing department as a graphic designer. During your employment
Line 7, 16:07:18: with Acme, can you describe your job duties and responsibilities? I was responsible for developing and
Line 8, 16:07:18: designing various marketing materials such as brochures, advertisements, and product packaging. I also
Line 9, 16:07:18: assisted with website design and social media graphics. Throughout your employment at Acme, did you
Line 10, 16:07:18: receive any performance reviews? Yes, I received annual reviews. All my reviews consistently rated me
Line 11, 16:07:18: as "meeting expectations" or exceeding expectations in certain areas. Did you ever receive any
Line 12, 16:07:18: disciplinary actions or warnings during your employment with Acme? No, I never did. Mr. Anderson,
Line 13, 16:07:18: during your time at Acme, did you witness or experience any situations that you felt could be considered
Line 14, 16:07:18: discriminatory based on your [Protected category, e.g., age, race, gender]?
Line 15, 16:07:18: Summary:
Line 16, 16:07:18: The excerpt is from a legal deposition of Michael Anderson, who is under oath to tell the truth. Mr.
Line 17, 16:07:18: Anderson confirms his employment at Acme Corporation as a graphic designer and details his job duties.
Line 18, 16:07:18: He also confirms receiving positive performance reviews and never facing disciplinary actions. The
Line 19, 16:07:18: excerpt ends with a question about witnessing or experiencing any discriminatory situations at Acme.

Line 20, 16:07:18: Deposition:
Line 21, 16:07:18: Objection, that question calls for legal conclusions from the witness. Withdrawn. Mr. Anderson, please
Line 22, 16:07:18: describe any specific incidents or instances at Acme that involved your [protected category]. There were
Line 23, 16:07:18: several things that made me feel uncomfortable. During meetings, colleagues often talked over me or
Line 24, 16:07:18: dismissed my ideas, particularly when compared to my younger male colleagues. I was also consistently
Line 25, 16:07:18: passed over for promotions despite having experience and qualifications comparable to others who got
Line 26, 16:07:18: promoted. Mr. Anderson, can you be specific about which colleagues treated you this way and provide
Line 27, 16:07:18: specific examples of situations where these incidents occurred? One specific example would be the
Line 28, 16:07:18: marketing campaign for the new product launch in 2023. I put significant effort into developing design
Line 29, 16:07:18: concepts, but they were ultimately disregarded without any explanation. My male colleague's design,
Line 30, 16:07:18: which was very similar to mine, was ultimately chosen. Did you ever report any of these incidents to
Line 31, 16:07:18: your supervisor or anyone else at Acme? I once mentioned feeling undervalued to my supervisor, but
Line 32, 16:07:18: they brushed it off, suggesting I needed to "work harder to prove myself." I wasn't comfortable bringing
Line 33, 16:07:18: it up further after that. Did you decide to leave Acme voluntarily, or were you terminated? When they
Line 34, 16:07:18: announced another promotion I felt qualified for, but was once again passed over without explanation, I
Line 35, 16:07:18: decided it was time to find a new position where I felt valued and respected. Mr. Anderson, can you
Line 36, 16:07:18: confirm that your decision to leave Acme was solely based on not receiving the promotion, and not due
Line 37, 16:07:18: to other factors like job performance or personal reasons? To the best of my knowledge, yes. It became
Line 38, 16:07:18: clear to me that further advancement opportunities within the company were unlikely. That's all my
Line 39, 16:07:18: questions at this time. Mr. Anderson, during your time at Acme, did you ever receive any negative
Line 40, 16:07:18: performance reviews or warnings related to your work performance? No, as mentioned before, my
Line 41, 16:07:18: performance reviews were always positive. Did you ever attend any diversity and inclusion training
Line 42, 16:07:18: offered by Acme during your employment? I did participate in the mandatory online training modules,
Line 43, 16:07:18: but there weren't any specific training sessions related to addressing or reporting potentially
Line 44, 16:07:18: discriminatory situations within the company.
Line 45, 16:07:18: Summary
Line 46, 16:07:18: The follow-up questioning delves deeper into Mr. Anderson's experiences at Acme. He details specific
Line 47, 16:07:18: examples of feeling sidelined and undervalued, particularly compared to younger male colleagues. He
Line 48, 16:07:18: mentions the disregarded product launch design concept and instances of being passed over for
Line 49, 16:07:18: promotions despite his qualifications. While not explicitly stating "discrimination," he highlights feeling
Line 50, 16:07:18: uncomfortable and unappreciated. When pressed for specific actions taken, he mentions mentioning his
Line 51, 16:07:18: feelings to a supervisor who dismissed them. He refrained from further complaints due to discomfort.
Line 52, 16:07:18: He clarifies that his decision to leave stemmed from the lack of advancement opportunities and feeling
Line 53, 16:07:18: undervalued, not performance issues or personal reasons. He reiterates his positive performance
Line 54, 16:07:18: reviews and confirms attending mandatory online diversity training, but mentions a lack of specific
Line 55, 16:07:18: training related to addressing potential discrimination.
Line 56, 16:07:18: Deposition:
Line 57, 16:07:18: Mr. Anderson, are you aware of Acme's anti-discrimination policy or how complaints of discrimination
Line 58, 16:07:18: are addressed within the company? I reviewed the employee handbook, which did explain the existence
Line 59, 16:07:18: of an anti-discrimination policy. However, I was unsure of the specific complaint process at the time. Mr.
Line 60, 16:07:18: Anderson, can you elaborate on why you felt apprehensive about bringing up these incidents to your
Line 61, 16:07:18: supervisor despite feeling uncomfortable and undervalued? Honestly, there were a few reasons. Firstly,
--- End of Page 2 ---

--- Beginning of Page 3 ---
Line 62, 16:07:18: as I mentioned, when I did hint at feeling undervalued to my supervisor, their dismissive response
Line 63, 16:07:18: discouraged me from further discussions. It seemed like they weren't receptive to hearing about any
Line 64, 16:07:18: potential issues. Secondly, there was a general company culture that made me hesitant to speak up.
Line 65, 16:07:18: Younger male colleagues often dominated conversations and presentations, and there weren't many
Line 66, 16:07:18: women in senior positions within the marketing department. It felt like my voice wouldn't be heard or
Line 67, 16:07:18: even worse, that bringing forward complaints might lead to retaliation or hinder my career further. Did
Line 68, 16:07:18: you notice any specific instances of retaliation against other employees who may have raised complaints
Line 69, 16:07:18: or concerns about work environment issues? While I can't say for sure, there was one colleague, Sarah
Line 70, 16:07:18: Lopez, who openly challenged gender bias during a department meeting but was subsequently given
Line 71, 16:07:18: less desirable project assignments compared to her male colleagues. This incident definitely reinforced
Line 72, 16:07:18: my concerns about potentially facing a similar situation. Objection, speculation about an unrelated case
Line 73, 16:07:18: is irrelevant to the present matter. Withdrawn. Mr. Anderson, did you ever discuss your concerns about
Line 74, 16:07:18: potential bias or lack of promotion opportunities with any human resources personnel at Acme? No, I
Line 75, 16:07:18: didn't. As I mentioned before, the lack of clarity on the specific complaint process combined with the
Line 76, 16:07:18: overall culture discouraged me from pursuing that route. Mr. Anderson, since leaving Acme, have you
Line 77, 16:07:18: sought employment elsewhere? Yes, I am currently employed at a different company and feel much
Line 78, 16:07:18: more valued and respected in my current role. The work environment is significantly more inclusive, and
Line 79, 16:07:18: I regularly receive positive feedback and opportunities for professional development. Mr. Anderson,
Line 80, 16:07:18: how has your experience at Acme impacted you personally and professionally? It was definitely a
Line 81, 16:07:18: frustrating and discouraging experience. It felt like my hard work and qualifications weren't being
Line 82, 16:07:18: recognized fairly, leading to some self-doubt and a sense of being undervalued. However, finding a new
Line 83, 16:07:18: and positive work environment has helped me rebuild my confidence and refocus on my career goals. I
Line 84, 16:07:18: have no further questions.
Line 85, 16:07:18: Summary
Line 86, 16:07:18: In an exit interview, Mr. Anderson explains his decision to leave Acme Corporation. He felt discouraged
Line 87, 16:07:18: by his supervisor's dismissal of his concerns and the company culture, which he perceived as
Line 88, 16:07:18: unreceptive and potentially punitive. He mentions a colleague, Sarah Lopez, who he believes faced
Line 89, 16:07:18: consequences for speaking up. Although he didn't formally file a complaint, he emphasizes the unclear
Line 90, 16:07:18: process and the unwelcoming company environment. Finally, Mr. Anderson confirms his new job and
Line 91, 16:07:18: highlights its positive aspects, contrasting them with his experience at Acme. He acknowledges the initial
Line 92, 16:07:18: negative impact of his time at Acme, including frustration and self-doubt, but emphasizes that his
Line 93, 16:07:18: current position has helped him regain confidence and refocus his career goals.
Line 94, 16:07:18: Deposition
Line 95, 16:07:18: I have one final question. Mr. Anderson, is there anything else you would like to add regarding your
Line 96, 16:07:18: experience at Acme Corporation? Just that I hope by sharing my story, it can contribute to fostering a
Line 97, 16:07:18: more diverse and inclusive work environment at Acme for future employees. Everyone deserves to feel
Line 98, 16:07:18: valued and respected in their workplace, regardless of their [protected category]. Interesting point, Mr.
Line 99, 16:07:18: Anderson. Ms. Garcia, while you have no further questions, I'd like to explore some aspects of Mr.
Line 100, 16:07:18: Anderson's experience further before concluding the deposition. No objection. Please proceed, Mr.
Line 101, 16:07:18: Thompson. Mr. Anderson, you mentioned feeling unsure about the specific complaint process at Acme.
Line 102, 16:07:18: Did you take any steps to learn more about it after your meeting with your supervisor? No, I didn't feel
Line 103, 16:07:18: comfortable approaching my supervisor again after their dismissive response. Additionally, I recall the
Line 104, 16:07:18: employee handbook being quite lengthy, and finding specific information about the complaint process
--- End of Page 3 ---

--- Beginning of Page 4 ---
Line 105, 16:07:18: proved difficult at the time. You mentioned a colleague, Sarah Lopez, who voiced concerns about gender
Line 106, 16:07:18: bias. Did you ever speak to her directly about her experience and the alleged retaliation she
Line 107, 16:07:18: faced? Briefly, yes. We expressed our mutual frustrations and the feeling of being undervalued within
Line 108, 16:07:18: the department. However, we were both hesitant to pursue any formal complaints due to the
Line 109, 16:07:18: aforementioned concerns about the company culture and potential retaliation. Did you ever discuss the
Line 110, 16:07:18: issue of lack of promotion opportunities with any other colleagues, particularly women in the marketing
Line 111, 16:07:18: department? Not directly. While there were a few women colleagues in the department, none of them
Line 112, 16:07:18: were in senior positions. The general environment discouraged open communication about potentially
Line 113, 16:07:18: sensitive topics like discrimination. Mr. Thompson, I object to leading the witness. Can you rephrase
Line 114, 16:07:18: your question and allow Mr. Anderson to answer in his own words? Apologies, Ms. Garcia. Mr.
Line 115, 16:07:18: Anderson, to clarify, did you have any informal conversations with other colleagues about your concerns
Line 116, 16:07:18: regarding promotion opportunities or potential gender bias within the marketing department at
Line 117, 16:07:18: Acme? There weren't any specific discussions about promotions or bias, but the general atmosphere
Line 118, 16:07:18: around the lack of female representation in senior positions was a frequent topic of quiet observation
Line 119, 16:07:18: amongst some female colleagues. We felt implicit pressure to work harder and prove ourselves more
Line 120, 16:07:18: than our male colleagues, but reaching leadership positions seemed like an increasingly distant
Line 121, 16:07:18: prospect. Mr. Anderson, can you elaborate on what kind of "pressure" you felt, and was there any
Line 122, 16:07:18: specific instance or behavior from colleagues or superiors that made you feel this way?
Line 123, 16:07:18: Summary
Line 124, 16:07:18: Mr. Anderson is wrapping up his deposition. He expresses hope that his story will contribute to a more
Line 125, 16:07:18: positive and inclusive work environment at Acme for future employees. The interviewer, Mr. Thompson,
Line 126, 16:07:18: has some additional questions. He asks Mr. Anderson about the complaint process at Acme and whether
Line 127, 16:07:18: he tried to learn more about it after his supervisor dismissed his concerns. Mr. Anderson admits he felt
Line 128, 16:07:18: uncomfortable going back to his supervisor and the employee handbook was difficult to navigate. The
Line 129, 16:07:18: conversation then turns to Sarah Lopez, a colleague who mentioned experiencing gender bias. Mr.
Line 130, 16:07:18: Anderson confirms having a brief conversation with her where they shared frustrations and felt
Line 131, 16:07:18: undervalued. However, both were hesitant to file formal complaints due to concerns about the
Line 132, 16:07:18: workplace culture. Mr. Thompson then asks about discussions regarding lack of promotion opportunities
Line 133, 16:07:18: for women. Mr. Anderson clarifies that while there weren't specific discussions, the lack of women in
Line 134, 16:07:18: senior positions and the overall environment discouraged open communication about sensitive topics
Line 135, 16:07:18: like gender bias. He describes a feeling of implicit pressure to outperform male colleagues, but achieving
Line 136, 16:07:18: leadership positions seemed unlikely. Finally, Mr. Thompson asks Mr. Anderson to elaborate on the
Line 137, 16:07:18: pressure he felt. Mr. Anderson is asked to provide specific examples, and the excerpt ends there.
Line 138, 16:07:18: Deposition
Line 139, 16:07:18: It wasn't any direct confrontation or statement, but more of a subtle feeling arising from observing the
Line 140, 16:07:18: lack of female representation in leadership roles combined with certain comments about needing to
Line 141, 16:07:18: "work harder" or "prove myself" despite my consistent positive performance reviews. Thank you, Mr.
Line 142, 16:07:18: Anderson. These are valuable insights. Do you have any further questions, Ms. Garcia? (after reviewing
Line 143, 16:07:18: her notes) I have a few follow-up questions for clarification. However, due to the time constraints, I
Line 144, 16:07:18: would like to schedule a follow-up session at your earliest convenience, Mr. Thompson, to continue
Line 145, 16:07:18: exploring specific details and potential evidence. No objection. Mr. Anderson, are you available for a
Line 146, 16:07:18: follow-up session within the next week? Yes, I am available. Please let me know the details when you've
--- End of Page 4 ---

--- Beginning of Page 5 ---
Line 147, 16:07:19: scheduled it Mr. Anderson, since our last session, have you had any time to review Acme Corporation's
Line 148, 16:07:19: employee handbook pertaining to the complaint process for potential discrimination? Yes, I have. Can
Line 149, 16:07:19: you briefly describe the steps outlined in the handbook for filing a complaint based on potential
Line 150, 16:07:19: discrimination? The handbook mentioned employees could submit a written complaint to the Human
Line 151, 16:07:19: Resources department or verbally report it to an HR representative or any manager. However, specific
Line 152, 16:07:19: details about the investigation process or resolution options were quite vague. Mr. Anderson, did the
Line 153, 16:07:19: employee handbook specify who constitutes a "manager" authorized to receive such initial verbal
Line 154, 16:07:19: complaints? No, it didn't provide any specific details about which managers were included in that
Line 155, 16:07:19: definition or if all managers were authorized to receive such reports. Mr. Anderson, you previously
Line 156, 16:07:19: mentioned frustration with receiving similar design concepts to yours being chosen over your own work
Line 157, 16:07:19: while working at Acme. Do you still have copies of these original design concepts and the final versions
Line 158, 16:07:19: ultimately used? Unfortunately, I didn't retain individual copies of every design iteration. However, I did
Line 159, 16:07:19: maintain some preliminary sketches and digital drafts from several projects, including the one discussed
Line 160, 16:07:19: earlier related to the 2023 product launch campaign. Would you be willing to provide these materials as
Line 161, 16:07:19: potential evidence in this case? Yes, I can bring them to the next session. Mr. Anderson, are you aware
Line 162, 16:07:19: of other colleagues who may have retained copies of their rejected design projects or drafts during their
Line 163, 16:07:19: employment at Acme? I'm not certain, but I remember several colleagues raising concerns about the
Line 164, 16:07:19: inconsistent feedback and selection process for design concepts. It's possible some of them might have
Line 165, 16:07:19: kept records for their own reference. We will look into that possibility. Mr. Anderson, during your time
Line 166, 16:07:19: at Acme, did you ever meet or hear about any employees who filed official complaints based on
Line 167, 16:07:19: experiencing discrimination? Not officially. As mentioned earlier, there was an underlying lack of
Line 168, 16:07:19: transparency and open communication around potentially sensitive topics like discrimination.
Line 169, 16:07:19: Therefore, it was difficult to know for sure. Mr. Anderson, did you receive any additional training or
Line 170, 16:07:19: workshops related to diversity and inclusion since leaving Acme Corporation? Yes, my current employer
Line 171, 16:07:19: offers comprehensive training programs and workshops regarding diversity and inclusion as part of their
Line 172, 16:07:19: ongoing commitment to a fair and equitable work environment. Do you find these additional training
Line 173, 16:07:19: programs and the overall work environment at your current company to be beneficial compared to your
Line 174, 16:07:19: experience at Acme? Absolutely. The focus on creating a safe space for open communication, valuing
Line 175, 16:07:19: diverse perspectives, and providing equal opportunities for growth has been incredibly positive and
Line 176, 16:07:19: empowering. No further questions at this time. Mr. Anderson, as mentioned previously, we would like
Line 177, 16:07:19: you to bring copies of the design materials you retained for the next session. Additionally, I may reach
Line 178, 16:07:19: out to inquire about potential colleagues who might have kept similar records. Is that alright? That's
Line 179, 16:07:19: perfectly fine. Please let me know if you need anything else in the meantime. Mr. Anderson, one final
Line 180, 16:07:19: question before we adjourn. You mentioned feeling hesitant to bring up your concerns to your
Line 181, 16:07:19: supervisor after their dismissive response. Did their reaction specifically mention any consequences of
Line 182, 16:07:19: raising the potential bias issue? Not directly. There wasn't an explicit threat of any sort. However, their
Line 183, 16:07:19: dismissive tone and the implication that my concerns weren't valid created an atmosphere where I felt
Line 184, 16:07:19: further discussion would be futile and potentially disadvantageous. Objection, speculation about the
Line 185, 16:07:19: witness's interpretation of a supervisor's tone is not based on facts. Reframing, Mr. Anderson. How did
Line 186, 16:07:19: your supervisor's response make you feel about the potential consequences of reporting your
Line 187, 16:07:19: concerns? Their response discouraged me and made me feel unheard. It conveyed the impression that
Line 188, 16:07:19: my concerns about potential bias wouldn't be taken seriously and could potentially hinder my career
Line 189, 16:07:19: progression within the company.

--- Beginning of Page 6 ---
Line 190, 16:07:19: Summary
Line 191, 16:07:19: In a follow-up deposition, Mr. Anderson clarified details about the complaint process at Acme and
Line 192, 16:07:19: confirmed reviewing the employee handbook. He mentioned the process outlines submitting a written
Line 193, 16:07:19: complaint to HR or verbally reporting it to an HR representative or a manager, but lacking specifics
Line 194, 16:07:19: about investigations or resolutions. He couldn't recall specific details about managers authorized to
Line 195, 16:07:19: receive verbal reports. Mr. Anderson admitted not keeping all design iterations but having some
Line 196, 16:07:19: sketches and drafts from specific projects, including the 2023 product launch campaign, which he
Line 197, 16:07:19: offered as potential evidence. He suggested some colleagues might have retained similar records due to
Line 198, 16:07:19: shared concerns about the selection process. While not aware of official complaints, Mr. Anderson
Line 199, 16:07:19: confirmed a lack of transparency around discrimination at Acme. He contrasted his current work
Line 200, 16:07:19: environment which offers diversity and inclusion training and fosters open communication, creating a
Line 201, 16:07:19: more positive and empowering experience compared to Acme. The session ended with Mr. Anderson
Line 202, 16:07:19: agreeing to bring design materials and potentially connect the interviewer with colleagues who might
Line 203, 16:07:19: have kept similar records. He clarified that while his supervisor's response didn't explicitly mention
Line 204, 16:07:19: consequences, the dismissive tone discouraged him and made him feel unheard, implying potential
Line 205, 16:07:19: career repercussions for raising concerns about bias.
Line 206, 16:07:19: Deposition
Line 207, 16:07:19: Mr. Thompson, I believe we've covered the essential topics for today. However, as these are complex
Line 208, 16:07:19: claims, I would appreciate the opportunity to review the transcript and potentially ask further questions
Line 209, 16:07:19: at a future session, should any need arise. No objection. Mr. Anderson, as Ms. Garcia mentioned, we
Line 210, 16:07:19: appreciate your willingness to cooperate and provide additional materials. We will be in touch to
Line 211, 16:07:19: schedule a follow-up session if needed. Understood.
Line 212, 16:07:19: Summary
Line 213, 16:07:19: Both parties agreed to conclude the deposition. The interviewer, Mr. Thompson, expressed the
Line 214, 16:07:19: possibility of needing a follow-up session after reviewing the transcript and potentially having further
Line 215, 16:07:19: questions. Mr. Anderson acknowledged this and confirmed his availability if needed.
Line 216, 16:07:19: Deposition
Line 217, 16:07:19: A driver is obligated to pay attention to the road and yield to other drivers when required. Let me take
Line 218, 16:07:19: you back to what happened on April 20th, 2022. The Defendant, who was an attorney for the IRS, was
Line 219, 16:07:19: driving her usual route to work. She drove down Annapolis Road to take a left onto another road. (Could
Line 220, 16:07:19: we have the next slide, please?) She was driving down this road… can everyone see this? She stopped at
Line 221, 16:07:19: a light on a clear day. While stopped, she reached down to find her parking pass. May we
Line 222, 16:07:19: approach? Yes. BENCH CONFERENCE (Bench Conference begins – 10:26:39m.) (The parties approach the
Line 223, 16:07:19: bench for a discussion.) By court ruling, liability has been established. The focus of this case is only on
Line 224, 16:07:19: damages. I understand why we’re discussing these details, but it’s about damages. I’m setting the scene
Line 225, 16:07:19: for the accident because her damages are part of the accident narrative. We’re only discussing the fact
Line 226, 16:07:19: that an accident happened and a person was injured. The details about reaching and negligence seem to
Line 227, 16:07:19: be evidence of liability. I understand. It’s your opening statement, so I’ll give you some leeway. I’m just
Line 228, 16:07:19: providing context. I’ll be getting into the damages soon. Alright. (Bench Conference concluded –

Line 229, 16:07:19: 10:27:32 m.) (The parties return to their places.) The Defendant heard a horn beep and took a left turn.
Line 230, 16:07:19: She didn’t see the Plaintiff, who had the right of way, coming from the opposite direction. Due to the
Line 231, 16:07:19: collision, the Plaintiff’s ankle was broken and required surgery. Take a look at these images. The first one
Line 232, 16:07:19: shows her ankle before surgery, the second one after surgery. Today, she still has 15 screws and three
Line 233, 16:07:19: plates in her ankle. She will never be able to run again and standing for extended periods of time is
Line 234, 16:07:19: difficult. We’ve brought this case before you because of the harm caused to the Plaintiff. We needed to
Line 235, 16:07:19: agree that the Defendant was at fault for the accident, which she has accepted. We also had to
Line 236, 16:07:19: understand the extent and implications of the Plaintiff’s damages, not just the initial injury and surgery,
Line 237, 16:07:19: but also its long-term impact on her life. To do this, we spoke to her doctors, her husband, her friends,
Line 238, 16:07:19: and even her employer. One of her doctors is going to talk to you. This is the guy to see if something
Line 239, 16:07:19: awful like this is going to happen to your ankle. He received an Ivy League education and, at one point,
Line 240, 16:07:19: was the chief of foot and ankle orthopedic injuries at Johns Hopkins. He consults for the Baltimore
Line 241, 16:07:19: Orioles. His resume, I want to say, is as long as your arm, but it’s actually a lot longer than that. We’re
Line 242, 16:07:19: going to bring him to talk to you guys, in a very 2023 way. It’s going to be by videotape, so his testimony
Line 243, 16:07:19: will be by videotape, but it holds the same force as if it was at trial, and he came here to see us. And, of
Line 244, 16:07:19: course, my partner Laura Zois and the defense attorney had an opportunity to ask him questions. He’s
Line 245, 16:07:19: going to tell you she still has 15 screws and three plates in her ankle holding everything together. The
Line 246, 16:07:19: problem with that is that it creates a breeding ground for arthritis, and this 33-year-old woman already
Line 247, 16:07:19: has the signs of arthritis. At some point, she’s going to need what’s called a fusion, which will stabilize
Line 248, 16:07:19: her ankle. The bad news is, you can’t move it once it locks, so you no longer have the ability to
Line 249, 16:07:19: bend. This trial is about the harms and losses that she has suffered and endured as the result of this
Line 250, 16:07:19: accident. This is not a case about sympathy. You should not award her damages because you feel sorry
Line 251, 16:07:19: for her. You’re going to hear about how the accident has impacted her professional and personal life. At
Line 252, 16:07:19: the time of the crash, they were a very young family. They were an energetic family. This is an active
Line 253, 16:07:19: family with four kids doing everything you can imagine, Six Flags, the park. They would run together.
Line 254, 16:07:19: They played basketball together. They traveled everywhere, New York, Baltimore, Washington, DC. They
Line 255, 16:07:19: were just a very active family. And she also had a vibrant social life. She was a hairstylist, and she loved
Line 256, 16:07:19: that job. It was her social outlet beside her kids. She would do the church choir every Wednesday, and
Line 257, 16:07:19: still found times to go out and see her family. She’s still fighting with her family, but it’s hard. She can’t
Line 258, 16:07:19: work as a hairstylist anymore. So what did she do? She went back to school to the University of
Line 259, 16:07:19: Maryland. She’s working, getting very close to getting her degree. She’s still fighting. She has four kids
Line 260, 16:07:19: they’re chasing around. Let’s go back and talk about how it ended up. Let’s talk about the accident. She
Line 261, 16:07:19: had this awful crash and needed emergency surgery where they put in these screws. She had a nine-
Line 262, 16:07:19: month-old baby, along with three other kids. She and the two girls, the younger ones, went to live with
Line 263, 16:07:19: her mom. Her mom took care of her and the girls, while her husband took care of the other kids. This
Line 264, 16:07:19: has been a massive disruption to their lives. The accident has completely changed her life, and it’s
Line 265, 16:07:19: reflected in every facet of her day-to-day. Her job, her family life, her hobbies, everything she used to
Line 266, 16:07:19: take pleasure in has been impacted in one way or another. And the evidence in this case will show these
Line 267, 16:07:19: changes are likely to persist for the rest of her life. We ask you to consider the totality of these changes,
Line 268, 16:07:19: the persistent harm and loss she’s suffered and will continue to suffer, as a direct result of the accident.
Line 269, 16:07:19: We ask you to consider these when coming to a decision in this case. This accident, however, led to an
Line 270, 16:07:19: upheaval in their lives. About a month after the accident, she managed to return home with the kids.
Line 271, 16:07:19: Her mother, an FDA employee, took three months off work to care for her, her daughter, and her
Line 272, 16:07:19: grandchildren. The accident wreaked havoc on their lives. She endured six months of rigorous physical
--- End of Page 7 ---

--- Beginning of Page 8 ---
Line 273, 16:07:19: therapy and another operation. While it was painful and difficult, the effort was worthwhile as it
Line 274, 16:07:19: improved her condition, especially her ankle, though we wish she had recovered more. As we delve into
Line 275, 16:07:19: this case, it’s about the harm and losses experienced. We will ask you to make amends where possible
Line 276, 16:07:19: and provide compensation for the irreparable harm. The damages can be categorized into three parts:
Line 277, 16:07:19: her medical bills, the post-accident trauma suffered by her and her family, and the pain she will endure
Line 278, 16:07:19: for the expected next 45 years of her life. She was a spontaneous person, fond of making impromptu
Line 279, 16:07:19: plans like going to Virginia Beach over the weekend or heading to the park. Now, every activity revolves
Line 280, 16:07:19: around her ability to reach there, her mobility, and whether she can tolerate the pain during the trip.
Line 281, 16:07:19: This situation has affected her and her four kids, as well as her husband. The court wants to clarify that
Line 282, 16:07:19: the evidence and testimonies from the witness stand are what will control your deliberations. Opening
Line 283, 16:07:19: statements and closing arguments of lawyers do not constitute evidence. This case is not just about the
Line 284, 16:07:19: suffering of their children or her husband. It’s about the impact of their suffering on her. We will ask you
Line 285, 16:07:19: to consider an amount that may seem high at the beginning. But we believe that after hearing all the
Line 286, 16:07:19: evidence, you’ll find it to be a fair compensation for her losses and harm. The amount we suggest is $1.1
Line 287, 16:07:19: million. Defense Opening Statement Regarding the defendant, they acknowledge the responsibility for
Line 288, 16:07:19: the accident and that it was their fault. The case is for you to determine the appropriate damages. The
Line 289, 16:07:19: injury is severe, and they ask for an extraordinary amount of compensation. She broke her ankle, which
Line 290, 16:07:19: was repaired surgically with plates and screws. There was a second surgery due to loosening of the
Line 291, 16:07:19: screws, which were then removed. She attended physical therapy, which improved her ability to move
Line 292, 16:07:19: her ankle. Whether she will need surgery in the future is uncertain. The past medical expenses are
Line 293, 16:07:19: around $36,505, which we don’t contest. Her lost wages due to the accident are around $3,400 to
Line 294, 16:07:19: $3,500. These are not the focal points of this case. The main issue is the amount to be awarded for non-
Line 295, 16:07:19: economic damages, for which we request something fair, reasonable, and sensible. Thank you for your
Line 296, 16:07:19: time and attention, and we hope to conclude this case promptly. Testimony of Victim’s Husband Mr.
Line 297, 16:07:19: Good morning. Can I have your address? Certainly. Mr. How long have you lived at that address? I
Line 298, 16:07:19: bought the house in 2003, so it’s been approximately ten years. Mr. Who lives there with you? My
Line 299, 16:07:19: wife, and our four children. Mr. Can you tell the jury how old your children are and their names? Yes.
Line 300, 16:07:19: My children are 13, and the others are… The Honorable Please continue. …five, and three. Mr. I
Line 301, 16:07:19: understand. And for some background, what do you do for a living? I’m currently the general manager
Line 302, 16:07:19: at Oreck Clean Home Center. Mr. And where are these locations? We have six locations in Maryland
Line 303, 16:07:19: and Virginia. Mr. What are your responsibilities at work? I oversee all six stores and manage one of
Line 304, 16:07:19: them. Mr. Can you describe your work schedule? I work Monday through Saturday, from 10:00 am to
Line 305, 16:07:19: 7:00 pm. Often, I work seven days a week which means working on Sundays from 12:00 pm to 5:00
Line 306, 16:07:19: pm. Mr. How do you feel about those hours? They are long, but I need to work to support my
Line 307, 16:07:19: family. Mr. How long have you known your wife? I met her in 1993, she was my sister’s best friend. Mr.
Line 308, 16:07:19: You mean your wife was your sister’s best friend? Yes, I apologize for the confusion. She was indeed my
Line 309, 16:07:19: sister’s best friend. Mr. Let’s move to another topic. Do you remember the car accident your wife was in
Line 310, 16:07:19: 2022? Yes, I do. Mr. Prior to the accident, can you describe your household? Our household was what I
Line 311, 16:07:19: would consider the perfect life. My wife and children were happy and always engaged in activities. We
Line 312, 16:07:19: used to take vacations and attend family reunions. Mr. Was your wife a spontaneous person or a
Line 313, 16:07:19: planner? She was more spontaneous, always ready to take on new activities. Mr. Could you describe
Line 314, 16:07:19: her for the jury? She is always happy, loves socializing and helping people. She attended choir rehearsal,
Line 315, 16:07:19: Bible study every week, and also took care of our four children. Mr. What was her job at the time of the
Line 316, 16:07:19: crash? She was the assistant manager of a hair salon. Mr. Did she enjoy her work? Yes, she loved her
--- End of Page 8 ---

--- Beginning of Page 9 ---
Line 317, 16:07:20: work. It was part of her identity. Mr. Did your wife’s demeanor change after the car accident? Yes, after
Line 318, 16:07:20: the accident everything changed. Our family life and activity level changed significantly. She used to take
Line 319, 16:07:20: the children to sporting events and practice basketball. Now, she can’t do these activities. She no longer
Line 320, 16:07:20: goes on family vacations. My two older sons call her “boring” now because of her reduced activity level.
Line 321, 16:07:20: The accident has restricted her capabilities and as a result, she can’t even do simple tasks like carrying
Line 322, 16:07:20: laundry baskets or standing up to cook. Our family life has changed drastically since the accident. Mr.
Line 323, 16:07:20: Has your wife gone back to work since the accident? She tried to help a friend out a couple of months
Line 324, 16:07:20: ago at her hair salon, but it ended with her in a lot of pain due to the swelling in her ankle. Mr. I have
Line 325, 16:07:20: here a picture you received from your wife. Is this the picture she sent you? Mr. Can you tell us how
Line 326, 16:07:20: your wife’s personal social life has been affected since the crash? Her social life has indeed changed
Line 327, 16:07:20: significantly. Before the accident, she would regularly go out with friends, engage in dancing, and other
Line 328, 16:07:20: social activities. However, the constant pain and discomfort after the crash have made such activities
Line 329, 16:07:20: impossible. Her social life is definitely not the same as before. Mr. You mentioned earlier about her job.
Line 330, 16:07:20: Was she able to resume work post the crash? She attempted to return to work, but the persistent pain
Line 331, 16:07:20: made it unmanageable, particularly the long-standing hours. Eventually, she was forced to leave her
Line 332, 16:07:20: job. Mr. How has this situation impacted your family’s finances? The impact has been substantial. She
Line 333, 16:07:20: held the position of an assistant manager at a hair salon, bringing in a significant income. Now, with my
Line 334, 16:07:20: single income, managing expenses for our four children and her medical bills has been strenuous. Mr.
Line 335, 16:07:20: Besides the financial struggle, can you share how your relationship with your wife has evolved post the
Line 336, 16:07:20: accident? Our relationship has undeniably been affected. She isn’t the same person she was before the
Line 337, 16:07:20: crash. Her constant pain and fatigue, coupled with frustration, have been hard on both of us. Mr. And
Line 338, 16:07:20: your children? How have they been coping with all these changes? Our children have had to make
Line 339, 16:07:20: significant adjustments. They miss the mother they had before the crash, not understanding why she
Line 340, 16:07:20: can’t engage in the activities she used to do with them. My older sons, in particular, have had to step up,
Line 341, 16:07:20: assisting more with household chores. It’s been a lot for them too. Mr. Finally, could you share your
Line 342, 16:07:20: hopes for your wife’s future? My biggest hope is for her to find relief from her pain and regain some
Line 343, 16:07:20: semblance of normalcy. She deserves to live her life, not just endure it. It’s challenging to see such a
Line 344, 16:07:20: wonderful person go through this. We are taking each day as it comes, hoping for a better
Line 345, 16:07:20: future. Defense Attorney Cross Examination of Victim’s Husband Regarding the foot stretching exercises,
Line 346, 16:07:20: you assist her with those? Yes, I do. Looking through her medical records, I noticed there’s mention of
Line 347, 16:07:20: an exercise bike at home. Do you have one? Indeed, we do have an exercise bike at home. Did she
Line 348, 16:07:20: frequently use the exercise bike, especially post-accident? Initially, during her therapy, they had her try
Line 349, 16:07:20: riding the exercise bike. Can you tell us what kind of exercises she did at home after the accident? She
Line 350, 16:07:20: was given a chart with exercises, and I’ve been helping her to flex her foot in both directions to try and
Line 351, 16:07:20: loosen it up. How long did this routine last? Actually, I still assist her with the foot exercises every
Line 352, 16:07:20: night. So you assist her based on the instructions from the chart? Not directly from the chart, but I’ve
Line 353, 16:07:20: learned the correct angles and try to flex her foot every night for her comfort and to aid her sleep. Does
Line 354, 16:07:20: she drive? Yes, she does. Prior to the accident, she was employed full time? Yes, that’s correct. The jury
Line 355, 16:07:20: was informed initially that she was also pursuing a degree? Yes, she was attending the University of
Line 356, 16:07:20: Maryland. Did she commute to the university? At certain points she did, but due to our four children,
Line 357, 16:07:20: she primarily takes her classes online now. How close is she to obtaining her degree? She’s expected to
Line 358, 16:07:20: graduate within the next year. Any redirect? Mr. No further questions, Your Honor. Thank you, sir, you
Line 359, 16:07:20: may step down. Proceed with your next witness. (Witness excused – 11:56:56 a.m.)

Line 360, 16:07:20: Summary
Line 361, 16:07:20: A woman is suing another driver, an attorney, for damages caused by a car accident. The defendant has
Line 362, 16:07:20: admitted fault, and the case revolves around the compensation the injured woman deserves. The
Line 363, 16:07:20: woman suffered a broken ankle requiring surgery and therapy. She still experiences pain and limited
Line 364, 16:07:20: mobility, impacting her daily life and activities. She had to quit her hairstyling job and is now pursuing a
Line 365, 16:07:20: degree to explore new career options. The accident also significantly affected her family life, including
Line 366, 16:07:20: her social life, ability to participate in activities with her children, and her relationship with her husband.
Line 367, 16:07:20: The woman seeks $1.1 million in compensation for her medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering,
Line 368, 16:07:20: and the long-term impact on her life. The defense acknowledges the severity of the injury but questions
Line 369, 16:07:20: the requested amount. They point out that the woman can still drive, is pursuing a degree, and hasn't
Line 370, 16:07:20: exhausted all treatments, like using an exercise bike at home. The case hinges on determining the extent
Line 371, 16:07:20: of the woman's long-term suffering and the impact on her life, balanced against the evidence presented
