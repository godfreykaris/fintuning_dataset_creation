Line 1, 16:07:13: Deposition:
Line 2, 16:07:13: Court Reporter: Please state your name for the record.
Line 3, 16:07:13: Witness: Sarah Miller.
Line 4, 16:07:13: Court Reporter: And how do you spell your last name, Ms. Miller?
Line 5, 16:07:13: Witness: M-I-L-L-E-R.
Line 6, 16:07:13: Mr. Brown: Ms. Miller, are you aware that today's proceedings are a legal deposition and that you are
Line 7, 16:07:13: under oath to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
Line 8, 16:07:13: Witness: Yes, I am aware.
Line 9, 16:07:13: Mr. Brown: Thank you. Ms. Miller, were you present at the intersection of Main Street and Maple
Line 10, 16:07:13: Avenue on July 15th, 2023, at approximately 3:00 pm?
Line 11, 16:07:13: Witness: Yes, I was. I was waiting at the red light on Maple Avenue, southbound, facing east.
Line 12, 16:07:13: Mr. Brown: Did you witness any accidents at that intersection at that time?
Line 13, 16:07:13: Witness: Yes, I did. I saw a car traveling westbound on Main Street, which I believe was a blue sedan, run
Line 14, 16:07:13: the red light and collide with a car traveling northbound on Maple Avenue, which I believe was a white
Line 15, 16:07:13: SUV.
Line 16, 16:07:13: Mr. Brown: Can you describe the collision in more detail?
Line 17, 16:07:13: Witness: The blue sedan seemed to be traveling at a high speed and didn't slow down or attempt to stop
Line 18, 16:07:13: at the red light. It hit the white SUV directly on the driver's side. The impact was quite forceful, and both
Line 19, 16:07:13: cars spun around significantly.
Line 20, 16:07:13: Mr. Lee: Ms. Miller, you mentioned the blue sedan was traveling at a high speed. How fast would you
Line 21, 16:07:13: say it was going?
Line 22, 16:07:13: Witness: It's difficult to say for sure, but it appeared to be going much faster than the posted speed
Line 23, 16:07:13: limit, which is 35 miles per hour.
Line 24, 16:07:13: Mr. Lee: Did you see the driver of either vehicle at any point?
Line 25, 16:07:13: Witness: No, I didn't.
Line 26, 16:07:13: Mr. Brown: Ms. Miller, did you notice anything unusual about the driver's behavior in the blue sedan
Line 27, 16:07:13: before the accident?
Line 28, 16:07:13: Witness: It's hard to say. Everything happened very quickly, but the car did seem to be swerving slightly
Line 29, 16:07:13: just before the collision.
Line 30, 16:07:13: Mr. Lee: Ms. Miller, did you call the police or offer assistance to anyone involved in the accident?
Line 31, 16:07:13: Witness: Yes, I immediately called 911 and stayed at the scene until the police arrived.
Line 32, 16:07:13: Mr. Brown: Did you speak to anyone else who may have witnessed the accident?
--- End of Page 1 ---

--- Beginning of Page 2 ---
Line 33, 16:07:13: Witness: Yes, I exchanged information with another driver who was stopped next to me on Maple
Line 34, 16:07:13: Avenue at the time.
Line 35, 16:07:13: Mr. Lee: Do you recall the make and model of the other vehicle that you spoke to?
Line 36, 16:07:13: Witness: I believe it was a silver Toyota Camry, but I'm not entirely sure.
Line 37, 16:07:13: Mr. Brown: That's all my questions at this time.
Line 38, 16:07:13: Mr. Lee: I have no further questions
Line 39, 16:07:13: Summary:
Line 40, 16:07:13: The excerpt is from a legal deposition of Michael Anderson, who is under oath to tell the truth. Mr.
Line 41, 16:07:13: Anderson confirms his employment at Acme Corporation as a graphic designer and details his job duties.
Line 42, 16:07:13: He also confirms receiving positive performance reviews and never facing disciplinary actions. The
Line 43, 16:07:13: excerpt ends with a question about witnessing or experiencing any discriminatory situations at Acme.
--- End of Page 2 ---

--- Beginning of Page 3 ---
Line 44, 16:07:13: Deposition:
Line 45, 16:07:13: Ms. Garcia: Objection, that question calls for legal conclusions from the witness.
Line 46, 16:07:13: Mr. Thompson: Withdrawn. Mr. Anderson, please describe any specific incidents or instances at Acme
Line 47, 16:07:13: that involved your [protected category].
Line 48, 16:07:13: Witness: There were several things that made me feel uncomfortable. During meetings, colleagues often
Line 49, 16:07:13: talked over me or dismissed my ideas, particularly when compared to my younger male colleagues. I
Line 50, 16:07:13: was also consistently passed over for promotions despite having experience and qualifications
Line 51, 16:07:13: comparable to others who got promoted.
Line 52, 16:07:13: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you be specific about which colleagues treated you this way and provide
Line 53, 16:07:13: specific examples of situations where these incidents occurred?
Line 54, 16:07:13: Witness: One specific example would be the marketing campaign for the new product launch in 2023. I
Line 55, 16:07:13: put significant effort into developing design concepts, but they were ultimately disregarded without any
Line 56, 16:07:13: explanation. My male colleague's design, which was very similar to mine, was ultimately chosen.
Line 57, 16:07:13: Mr. Thompson: Did you ever report any of these incidents to your supervisor or anyone else at Acme?
Line 58, 16:07:13: Witness: I once mentioned feeling undervalued to my supervisor, but they brushed it off, suggesting I
Line 59, 16:07:13: needed to "work harder to prove myself." I wasn't comfortable bringing it up further after that.
Line 60, 16:07:13: Mr. Thompson: Did you decide to leave Acme voluntarily, or were you terminated?
Line 61, 16:07:13: Witness: When they announced another promotion I felt qualified for, but was once again passed over
Line 62, 16:07:13: without explanation, I decided it was time to find a new position where I felt valued and respected.
Line 63, 16:07:13: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you confirm that your decision to leave Acme was solely based on not
Line 64, 16:07:13: receiving the promotion, and not due to other factors like job performance or personal reasons?
Line 65, 16:07:13: Witness: To the best of my knowledge, yes. It became clear to me that further advancement
Line 66, 16:07:13: opportunities within the company were unlikely.
Line 67, 16:07:13: Mr. Thompson: That's all my questions at this time.
Line 68, 16:07:13: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, during your time at Acme, did you ever receive any negative performance
Line 69, 16:07:13: reviews or warnings related to your work performance?
Line 70, 16:07:13: Witness: No, as mentioned before, my performance reviews were always positive.
Line 71, 16:07:13: Ms. Garcia: Did you ever attend any diversity and inclusion training offered by Acme during your
Line 72, 16:07:13: employment?
Line 73, 16:07:13: Witness: I did participate in the mandatory online training modules, but there weren't any specific
Line 74, 16:07:13: training sessions related to addressing or reporting potentially discriminatory situations within the
Line 75, 16:07:13: company.
Line 76, 16:07:13: Summary
--- End of Page 3 ---

--- Beginning of Page 4 ---
Line 77, 16:07:13: Michael Anderson details specific incidents supporting his feeling of being undervalued based on his
Line 78, 16:07:13: protected category. He describes colleagues disregarding his ideas and being passed over for
Line 79, 16:07:13: promotions despite comparable qualifications. He provides a specific example from the 2023 product
Line 80, 16:07:13: launch where his design was overlooked in favor of a male colleague's similar work. He mentions
Line 81, 16:07:13: mentioning his concerns to his supervisor but being discouraged from pursuing them. He clarifies his
Line 82, 16:07:13: decision to leave Acme was due to the lack of advancement opportunities, not performance or personal
Line 83, 16:07:13: reasons. Ms. Garcia then establishes that Mr. Anderson's performance was consistently good and that
Line 84, 16:07:13: he participated in available diversity training while at Acme, though specific training for addressing
Line 85, 16:07:13: potential discrimination was absent.
Line 86, 16:07:13: Deposition:
Line 87, 16:07:13: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, are you aware of Acme's anti-discrimination policy or how complaints of
Line 88, 16:07:13: discrimination are addressed within the company?
Line 89, 16:07:13: Witness: I reviewed the employee handbook, which did explain the existence of an anti-discrimination
Line 90, 16:07:13: policy. However, I was unsure of the specific complaint process at the time
Line 91, 16:07:13: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you elaborate on why you felt apprehensive about bringing up these
Line 92, 16:07:13: incidents to your supervisor despite feeling uncomfortable and undervalued?
Line 93, 16:07:13: Witness: Honestly, there were a few reasons. Firstly, as I mentioned, when I did hint at feeling
Line 94, 16:07:13: undervalued to my supervisor, their dismissive response discouraged me from further discussions. It
Line 95, 16:07:13: seemed like they weren't receptive to hearing about any potential issues.
Line 96, 16:07:13: Secondly, there was a general company culture that made me hesitant to speak up. Younger male
Line 97, 16:07:13: colleagues often dominated conversations and presentations, and there weren't many women in senior
Line 98, 16:07:13: positions within the marketing department. It felt like my voice wouldn't be heard or even worse, that
Line 99, 16:07:13: bringing forward complaints might lead to retaliation or hinder my career further.
Line 100, 16:07:13: Ms. Garcia: Did you notice any specific instances of retaliation against other employees who may have
Line 101, 16:07:13: raised complaints or concerns about work environment issues?
Line 102, 16:07:13: Witness: While I can't say for sure, there was one colleague, Sarah Lopez, who openly challenged gender
Line 103, 16:07:13: bias during a department meeting but was subsequently given less desirable project assignments
Line 104, 16:07:13: compared to her male colleagues. This incident definitely reinforced my concerns about potentially
Line 105, 16:07:13: facing a similar situation.**
Line 106, 16:07:13: Mr. Thompson: Objection, speculation about an unrelated case is irrelevant to the present matter.
Line 107, 16:07:13: Ms. Garcia: Withdrawn. Mr. Anderson, did you ever discuss your concerns about potential bias or lack of
Line 108, 16:07:13: promotion opportunities with any human resources personnel at Acme?
Line 109, 16:07:13: Witness: No, I didn't. As I mentioned before, the lack of clarity on the specific complaint process
Line 110, 16:07:13: combined with the overall culture discouraged me from pursuing that route.
Line 111, 16:07:13: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, since leaving Acme, have you sought employment elsewhere?
--- End of Page 4 ---

--- Beginning of Page 5 ---
Line 112, 16:07:14: Witness: Yes, I am currently employed at a different company and feel much more valued and respected
Line 113, 16:07:14: in my current role. The work environment is significantly more inclusive, and I regularly receive positive
Line 114, 16:07:14: feedback and opportunities for professional development.
Line 115, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, how has your experience at Acme impacted you personally and
Line 116, 16:07:14: professionally?
Line 117, 16:07:14: Witness: It was definitely a frustrating and discouraging experience. It felt like my hard work and
Line 118, 16:07:14: qualifications weren't being recognized fairly, leading to some self-doubt and a sense of being
Line 119, 16:07:14: undervalued. However, finding a new and positive work environment has helped me rebuild my
Line 120, 16:07:14: confidence and refocus on my career goals.
Line 121, 16:07:14: Ms. Garcia: I have no further questions.
Line 122, 16:07:14: Summary
Line 123, 16:07:14: This segment explores Mr. Anderson's reasons for not formally complaining despite feeling undervalued.
Line 124, 16:07:14: He reiterates his supervisor's dismissive response and the perceived lack of receptiveness within the
Line 125, 16:07:14: company culture. He describes a specific instance where a colleague who challenged gender bias faced
Line 126, 16:07:14: negative consequences, reinforcing his fear of retaliation. He clarifies that he didn't pursue HR due to
Line 127, 16:07:14: unclear procedures and the discouraging company culture. Finally, he highlights his positive experience
Line 128, 16:07:14: at a new company, emphasizing feelings of value, inclusion, and professional growth in contrast to his
Line 129, 16:07:14: experience at Acme. He concludes by acknowledging the frustration and self-doubt from Acme but also
Line 130, 16:07:14: the positive impact of finding a supportive work environment.
Line 131, 16:07:14: Deposition
Line 132, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: I have one final question. Mr. Anderson, is there anything else you would like to add
Line 133, 16:07:14: regarding your experience at Acme Corporation?
Line 134, 16:07:14: Witness: Just that I hope by sharing my story, it can contribute to fostering a more diverse and inclusive
Line 135, 16:07:14: work environment at Acme for future employees. Everyone deserves to feel valued and respected in
Line 136, 16:07:14: their workplace, regardless of their [protected category].
Line 137, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Interesting point, Mr. Anderson. Ms. Garcia, while you have no further questions, I'd like
Line 138, 16:07:14: to explore some aspects of Mr. Anderson's experience further before concluding the deposition.
Line 139, 16:07:14: Ms. Garcia: No objection. Please proceed, Mr. Thompson.
Line 140, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, you mentioned feeling unsure about the specific complaint process at
Line 141, 16:07:14: Acme. Did you take any steps to learn more about it after your meeting with your supervisor?
Line 142, 16:07:14: Witness: No, I didn't feel comfortable approaching my supervisor again after their dismissive response.
Line 143, 16:07:14: Additionally, I recall the employee handbook being quite lengthy, and finding specific information about
Line 144, 16:07:14: the complaint process proved difficult at the time.
--- End of Page 5 ---

--- Beginning of Page 6 ---
Line 145, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: You mentioned a colleague, Sarah Lopez, who voiced concerns about gender bias. Did
Line 146, 16:07:14: you ever speak to her directly about her experience and the alleged retaliation she faced?
Line 147, 16:07:14: Witness: Briefly, yes. We expressed our mutual frustrations and the feeling of being undervalued within
Line 148, 16:07:14: the department. However, we were both hesitant to pursue any formal complaints due to the
Line 149, 16:07:14: aforementioned concerns about the company culture and potential retaliation.
Line 150, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Did you ever discuss the issue of lack of promotion opportunities with any other
Line 151, 16:07:14: colleagues, particularly women in the marketing department?
Line 152, 16:07:14: Witness: Not directly. While there were a few women colleagues in the department, none of them were
Line 153, 16:07:14: in senior positions. The general environment discouraged open communication about potentially
Line 154, 16:07:14: sensitive topics like discrimination.
Line 155, 16:07:14: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Thompson, I object to leading the witness. Can you rephrase your question and allow
Line 156, 16:07:14: Mr. Anderson to answer in his own words?
Line 157, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Apologies, Ms. Garcia. Mr. Anderson, to clarify, did you have any informal conversations
Line 158, 16:07:14: with other colleagues about your concerns regarding promotion opportunities or potential gender bias
Line 159, 16:07:14: within the marketing department at Acme?
Line 160, 16:07:14: Witness: There weren't any specific discussions about promotions or bias, but the general atmosphere
Line 161, 16:07:14: around the lack of female representation in senior positions was a frequent topic of quiet observation
Line 162, 16:07:14: amongst some female colleagues. We felt implicit pressure to work harder and prove ourselves more
Line 163, 16:07:14: than our male colleagues, but reaching leadership positions seemed like an increasingly distant
Line 164, 16:07:14: prospect.
Line 165, 16:07:14: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you elaborate on what kind of "pressure" you felt, and was there any
Line 166, 16:07:14: specific instance or behavior from colleagues or superiors that made you feel this way?
Line 167, 16:07:14: Summary
Line 168, 16:07:14: In the concluding segment, Mr. Anderson expresses hope that his experience can contribute to a more
Line 169, 16:07:14: inclusive work environment at Acme. Mr. Thompson then delves deeper into specific aspects of Mr.
Line 170, 16:07:14: Anderson's experience:
Line 171, 16:07:14: Complaint process: Mr. Anderson cites discomfort following his supervisor's reaction and difficulty
Line 172, 16:07:14: navigating the lengthy employee handbook as reasons for not seeking further information.
Line 173, 16:07:14: Colleague's experience: He mentions briefly discussing his frustrations and concerns with Sarah Lopez
Line 174, 16:07:14: but clarifies their shared hesitation to pursue formal complaints due to company culture concerns.
Line 175, 16:07:14: Promotion opportunities and gender bias: He explains the lack of open communication about these
Line 176, 16:07:14: issues and feeling unspoken pressure due to the absence of women in senior positions, though no
Line 177, 16:07:14: specific discussions on bias occurred.
Line 178, 16:07:14: Ms. Garcia objects to a leading question about bias, and Mr. Thompson rephrases, allowing Mr.
Line 179, 16:07:14: Anderson to clarify further. He explains the silent observation among female colleagues of the lack of
--- End of Page 6 ---

--- Beginning of Page 7 ---
Line 180, 16:07:14: female leadership and the perceived need to overachieve compared to male colleagues. Ms. Garcia
Line 181, 16:07:14: requests further details about the pressure felt by Mr. Anderson.
Line 182, 16:07:14: Deposition
Line 183, 16:07:14: Witness: It wasn't any direct confrontation or statement, but more of a subtle feeling arising from
Line 184, 16:07:14: observing the lack of female representation in leadership roles combined with certain comments about
Line 185, 16:07:14: needing to "work harder" or "prove myself" despite my consistent positive performance reviews.
Line 186, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Thank you, Mr. Anderson. These are valuable insights. Do you have any further
Line 187, 16:07:14: questions, Ms. Garcia?
Line 188, 16:07:14: Ms. Garcia: (after reviewing her notes) I have a few follow-up questions for clarification. However, due
Line 189, 16:07:14: to the time constraints, I would like to schedule a follow-up session at your earliest convenience, Mr.
Line 190, 16:07:14: Thompson, to continue exploring specific details and potential evidence.
Line 191, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: No objection. Mr. Anderson, are you available for a follow-up session within the next
Line 192, 16:07:14: week?
Line 193, 16:07:14: Witness: Yes, I am available. Please let me know the details when you've scheduled it
Line 194, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, since our last session, have you had any time to review Acme
Line 195, 16:07:14: Corporation's employee handbook pertaining to the complaint process for potential discrimination?
Line 196, 16:07:14: Witness: Yes, I have.
Line 197, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Can you briefly describe the steps outlined in the handbook for filing a complaint based
Line 198, 16:07:14: on potential discrimination?
Line 199, 16:07:14: Witness: The handbook mentioned employees could submit a written complaint to the Human
Line 200, 16:07:14: Resources department or verbally report it to an HR representative or any manager. However, specific
Line 201, 16:07:14: details about the investigation process or resolution options were quite vague.
Line 202, 16:07:14: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, did the employee handbook specify who constitutes a "manager" authorized
Line 203, 16:07:14: to receive such initial verbal complaints?
Line 204, 16:07:14: Witness: No, it didn't provide any specific details about which managers were included in that definition
Line 205, 16:07:14: or if all managers were authorized to receive such reports.
Line 206, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, you previously mentioned frustration with receiving similar design
Line 207, 16:07:14: concepts to yours being chosen over your own work while working at Acme. Do you still have copies of
Line 208, 16:07:14: these original design concepts and the final versions ultimately used?
Line 209, 16:07:14: Witness: Unfortunately, I didn't retain individual copies of every design iteration. However, I did
Line 210, 16:07:14: maintain some preliminary sketches and digital drafts from several projects, including the one discussed
Line 211, 16:07:14: earlier related to the 2023 product launch campaign.
Line 212, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Would you be willing to provide these materials as potential evidence in this case?
Line 213, 16:07:14: Witness: Yes, I can bring them to the next session.
--- End of Page 7 ---

--- Beginning of Page 8 ---
Line 214, 16:07:14: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, are you aware of other colleagues who may have retained copies of their
Line 215, 16:07:14: rejected design projects or drafts during their employment at Acme?
Line 216, 16:07:14: Witness: I'm not certain, but I remember several colleagues raising concerns about the inconsistent
Line 217, 16:07:14: feedback and selection process for design concepts. It's possible some of them might have kept records
Line 218, 16:07:14: for their own reference.
Line 219, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: We will look into that possibility. Mr. Anderson, during your time at Acme, did you ever
Line 220, 16:07:14: meet or hear about any employees who filed official complaints based on experiencing discrimination?
Line 221, 16:07:14: Witness: Not officially. As mentioned earlier, there was an underlying lack of transparency and open
Line 222, 16:07:14: communication around potentially sensitive topics like discrimination. Therefore, it was difficult to know
Line 223, 16:07:14: for sure.
Line 224, 16:07:14: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, did you receive any additional training or workshops related to diversity and
Line 225, 16:07:14: inclusion since leaving Acme Corporation?
Line 226, 16:07:14: Witness: Yes, my current employer offers comprehensive training programs and workshops regarding
Line 227, 16:07:14: diversity and inclusion as part of their ongoing commitment to a fair and equitable work environment.
Line 228, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Do you find these additional training programs and the overall work environment at
Line 229, 16:07:14: your current company to be beneficial compared to your experience at Acme?
Line 230, 16:07:14: Witness: Absolutely. The focus on creating a safe space for open communication, valuing diverse
Line 231, 16:07:14: perspectives, and providing equal opportunities for growth has been incredibly positive and
Line 232, 16:07:14: empowering.
Line 233, 16:07:14: Ms. Garcia: No further questions at this time.
Line 234, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, as mentioned previously, we would like you to bring copies of the design
Line 235, 16:07:14: materials you retained for the next session. Additionally, I may reach out to inquire about potential
Line 236, 16:07:14: colleagues who might have kept similar records. Is that alright?
Line 237, 16:07:14: Witness: That's perfectly fine. Please let me know if you need anything else in the meantime.
Line 238, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, one final question before we adjourn. You mentioned feeling hesitant to
Line 239, 16:07:14: bring up your concerns to your supervisor after their dismissive response. Did their reaction specifically
Line 240, 16:07:14: mention any consequences of raising the potential bias issue?
Line 241, 16:07:14: Witness: Not directly. There wasn't an explicit threat of any sort. However, their dismissive tone and the
Line 242, 16:07:14: implication that my concerns weren't valid created an atmosphere where I felt further discussion would
Line 243, 16:07:14: be futile and potentially disadvantageous.
Line 244, 16:07:14: Ms. Garcia: Objection, speculation about the witness's interpretation of a supervisor's tone is not based
Line 245, 16:07:14: on facts.
Line 246, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Reframing, Mr. Anderson. How did your supervisor's response make you feel about the
Line 247, 16:07:14: potential consequences of reporting your concerns?

Line 248, 16:07:15: Witness: Their response discouraged me and made me feel unheard. It conveyed the impression that my
Line 249, 16:07:15: concerns about potential bias wouldn't be taken seriously and could potentially hinder my career
Line 250, 16:07:15: progression within the company.
Line 251, 16:07:15: Summary
Line 252, 16:07:15: The concluding segment addresses further details and sets the stage for a follow-up session:
Line 253, 16:07:15: Complaint process: Mr. Anderson reviews the handbook and describes the outlined steps for filing a
Line 254, 16:07:15: complaint, noting the vagueness regarding investigation and resolution. Ms. Garcia highlights the lack of
Line 255, 16:07:15: clarity on who qualifies as a "manager" authorized to receive initial verbal reports.
Line 256, 16:07:15: Design concepts: Mr. Anderson clarifies he still possesses some preliminary sketches and drafts,
Line 257, 16:07:15: including those from the 2023 product launch, and agrees to provide them as potential evidence. Mr.
Line 258, 16:07:15: Thompson expresses interest in exploring the possibility of other colleagues retaining similar materials.
Line 259, 16:07:15: Official complaints: Mr. Anderson reiterates the lack of knowledge about any official discrimination
Line 260, 16:07:15: complaints at Acme due to the previously mentioned culture of secrecy.
Line 261, 16:07:15: Current company: Mr. Anderson confirms receiving additional diversity and inclusion training at his
Line 262, 16:07:15: current company. He emphasizes the positive aspects of his new work environment, highlighting open
Line 263, 16:07:15: communication, valuing diverse perspectives, and equal opportunities, contrasting it with his experience
Line 264, 16:07:15: at Acme.
Line 265, 16:07:15: Follow-up: Both parties agree to a follow-up session. Mr. Thompson clarifies his intention to request the
Line 266, 16:07:15: design materials and potentially contact other colleagues. Ms. Garcia objects to the witness's
Line 267, 16:07:15: interpretation of his supervisor's tone, leading Mr. Thompson to rephrase the question, to which Mr.
Line 268, 16:07:15: Anderson reiterates feeling discouraged and unheard, fearing his concerns wouldn't be taken seriously
Line 269, 16:07:15: and could hinder his career.
Line 270, 16:07:15: Deposition
Line 271, 16:07:15: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Thompson, I believe we've covered the essential topics for today. However, as these are
Line 272, 16:07:15: complex claims, I would appreciate the opportunity to review the transcript and potentially ask further
Line 273, 16:07:15: questions at a future session, should any need arise.
Line 274, 16:07:15: Mr. Thompson: No objection. Mr. Anderson, as Ms. Garcia mentioned, we appreciate your willingness to
Line 275, 16:07:15: cooperate and provide additional materials. We will be in touch to schedule a follow-up session if
Line 276, 16:07:15: needed.
Line 277, 16:07:15: Witness: Understood.
Line 278, 16:07:15: Summary
Line 279, 16:07:15: The deposition concludes with Ms. Garcia expressing a desire to review the transcript and potentially
Line 280, 16:07:15: ask further questions in a future session if needed. Mr. Thompson agrees, and both thank Mr. Anderson
Line 281, 16:07:15: for his cooperation and willingness to provide additional materials. Mr. Anderson acknowledges their
Line 282, 16:07:15: communication and awaits further information regarding a potential follow-up session.

Line 283, 16:07:15: Deposition
Line 284, 16:07:15: MILLER: A driver is obligated to pay attention to the road and yield to other drivers when required. Let
Line 285, 16:07:15: me take you back to what happened on April 20th, 2022. The Defendant, who was an attorney for the
Line 286, 16:07:15: IRS, was driving her usual route to work. She drove down Annapolis Road to take a left onto another
Line 287, 16:07:15: road.
Line 288, 16:07:15: (Could we have the next slide, please?) She was driving down this road… can everyone see this? She
Line 289, 16:07:15: stopped at a light on a clear day. While stopped, she reached down to find her parking pass.
Line 290, 16:07:15: DEFENSE LAWYER: May we approach?
Line 291, 16:07:15: THE COURT: Yes.
Line 292, 16:07:15: BENCH CONFERENCE
Line 293, 16:07:15: (Bench Conference begins – 10:26:39m.)
Line 294, 16:07:15: (The parties approach the bench for a discussion.)
Line 295, 16:07:15: THE COURT: By court ruling, liability has been established. The focus of this case is only on damages. I
Line 296, 16:07:15: understand why we’re discussing these details, but it’s about damages.
Line 297, 16:07:15: MILLER: I’m setting the scene for the accident because her damages are part of the accident narrative.
Line 298, 16:07:15: DEFENSE LAWYER: We’re only discussing the fact that an accident happened and a person was injured.
Line 299, 16:07:15: The details about reaching and negligence seem to be evidence of liability.
Line 300, 16:07:15: THE COURT: I understand. It’s your opening statement, so I’ll give you some leeway.
Line 301, 16:07:15: MILLER: I’m just providing context. I’ll be getting into the damages soon.
Line 302, 16:07:15: THE COURT: Alright.
Line 303, 16:07:15: (Bench Conference concluded – 10:27:32 m.)
Line 304, 16:07:15: (The parties return to their places.)
Line 305, 16:07:15: MILLER: The Defendant heard a horn beep and took a left turn. She didn’t see the Plaintiff, who had the
Line 306, 16:07:15: right of way, coming from the opposite direction. Due to the collision, the Plaintiff’s ankle was broken
Line 307, 16:07:15: and required surgery.
Line 308, 16:07:15: Take a look at these images. The first one shows her ankle before surgery, the second one after surgery.
Line 309, 16:07:15: Today, she still has 15 screws and three plates in her ankle. She will never be able to run again and
Line 310, 16:07:15: standing for extended periods of time is difficult.
Line 311, 16:07:15: We’ve brought this case before you because of the harm caused to the Plaintiff. We needed to agree
Line 312, 16:07:15: that the Defendant was at fault for the accident, which she has accepted. We also had to understand the
Line 313, 16:07:15: extent and implications of the Plaintiff’s damages, not just the initial injury and surgery, but also its long-
Line 314, 16:07:15: term impact on her life.
Line 315, 16:07:15: To do this, we spoke to her doctors, her husband, her friends, and even her employer. One of her
Line 316, 16:07:15: doctors is going to talk to you.
--- End of Page 10 ---

--- Beginning of Page 11 ---
Line 317, 16:07:15: This is the guy to see if something awful like this is going to happen to your ankle. He received an Ivy
Line 318, 16:07:15: League education and, at one point, was the chief of foot and ankle orthopedic injuries at Johns
Line 319, 16:07:15: Hopkins. He consults for the Baltimore Orioles. His resume, I want to say, is as long as your arm, but it’s
Line 320, 16:07:15: actually a lot longer than that.
Line 321, 16:07:15: We’re going to bring him to talk to you guys, in a very 2023 way. It’s going to be by videotape, so his
Line 322, 16:07:15: testimony will be by videotape, but it holds the same force as if it was at trial, and he came here to see
Line 323, 16:07:15: us. And, of course, my partner Laura Zois and the defense attorney had an opportunity to ask him
Line 324, 16:07:15: questions.
Line 325, 16:07:15: He’s going to tell you she still has 15 screws and three plates in her ankle holding everything together.
Line 326, 16:07:15: The problem with that is that it creates a breeding ground for arthritis, and this 33-year-old woman
Line 327, 16:07:15: already has the signs of arthritis. At some point, she’s going to need what’s called a fusion, which will
Line 328, 16:07:15: stabilize her ankle. The bad news is, you can’t move it once it locks, so you no longer have the ability to
Line 329, 16:07:15: bend.
Line 330, 16:07:15: This trial is about the harms and losses that she has suffered and endured as the result of this accident.
Line 331, 16:07:15: This is not a case about sympathy. You should not award her damages because you feel sorry for her.
Line 332, 16:07:15: You’re going to hear about how the accident has impacted her professional and personal life.
Line 333, 16:07:15: At the time of the crash, they were a very young family. They were an energetic family. This is an active
Line 334, 16:07:15: family with four kids doing everything you can imagine, Six Flags, the park. They would run together.
Line 335, 16:07:15: They played basketball together. They traveled everywhere, New York, Baltimore, Washington, DC. They
Line 336, 16:07:15: were just a very active family.
Line 337, 16:07:15: And she also had a vibrant social life. She was a hairstylist, and she loved that job. It was her social outlet
Line 338, 16:07:15: beside her kids. She would do the church choir every Wednesday, and still found times to go out and see
Line 339, 16:07:15: her family. She’s still fighting with her family, but it’s hard.
Line 340, 16:07:15: She can’t work as a hairstylist anymore. So what did she do? She went back to school to the University
Line 341, 16:07:15: of Maryland. She’s working, getting very close to getting her degree. She’s still fighting. She has four kids
Line 342, 16:07:15: they’re chasing around.
Line 343, 16:07:15: Let’s go back and talk about how it ended up. Let’s talk about the accident. She had this awful crash and
Line 344, 16:07:15: needed emergency surgery where they put in these screws. She had a nine-month-old baby, along with
Line 345, 16:07:15: three other kids. She and the two girls, the younger ones, went to live with her mom. Her mom took
Line 346, 16:07:15: care of her and the girls, while her husband took care of the other kids.
Line 347, 16:07:15: This has been a massive disruption to their lives. The accident has completely changed her life, and it’s
Line 348, 16:07:15: reflected in every facet of her day-to-day. Her job, her family life, her hobbies, everything she used to
Line 349, 16:07:15: take pleasure in has been impacted in one way or another. And the evidence in this case will show these
Line 350, 16:07:15: changes are likely to persist for the rest of her life.
Line 351, 16:07:15: We ask you to consider the totality of these changes, the persistent harm and loss she’s suffered and
Line 352, 16:07:15: will continue to suffer, as a direct result of the accident. We ask you to consider these when coming to a
Line 353, 16:07:15: decision in this case.
--- End of Page 11 ---

--- Beginning of Page 12 ---
Line 354, 16:07:15: This accident, however, led to an upheaval in their lives. About a month after the accident, she managed
Line 355, 16:07:15: to return home with the kids. Her mother, an FDA employee, took three months off work to care for her,
Line 356, 16:07:15: her daughter, and her grandchildren. The accident wreaked havoc on their lives.
Line 357, 16:07:15: She endured six months of rigorous physical therapy and another operation. While it was painful and
Line 358, 16:07:15: difficult, the effort was worthwhile as it improved her condition, especially her ankle, though we wish
Line 359, 16:07:15: she had recovered more.
Line 360, 16:07:15: As we delve into this case, it’s about the harm and losses experienced. We will ask you to make amends
Line 361, 16:07:15: where possible and provide compensation for the irreparable harm. The damages can be categorized
Line 362, 16:07:15: into three parts: her medical bills, the post-accident trauma suffered by her and her family, and the pain
Line 363, 16:07:15: she will endure for the expected next 45 years of her life.
Line 364, 16:07:15: She was a spontaneous person, fond of making impromptu plans like going to Virginia Beach over the
Line 365, 16:07:15: weekend or heading to the park. Now, every activity revolves around her ability to reach there, her
Line 366, 16:07:15: mobility, and whether she can tolerate the pain during the trip. This situation has affected her and her
Line 367, 16:07:15: four kids, as well as her husband.
Line 368, 16:07:15: The court wants to clarify that the evidence and testimonies from the witness stand are what will
Line 369, 16:07:15: control your deliberations. Opening statements and closing arguments of lawyers do not constitute
Line 370, 16:07:15: evidence.
Line 371, 16:07:15: This case is not just about the suffering of their children or her husband. It’s about the impact of their
Line 372, 16:07:15: suffering on her. We will ask you to consider an amount that may seem high at the beginning. But we
Line 373, 16:07:15: believe that after hearing all the evidence, you’ll find it to be a fair compensation for her losses and
Line 374, 16:07:15: harm. The amount we suggest is $1.1 million.
Line 375, 16:07:15: Defense Opening Statement
Line 376, 16:07:15: Regarding the defendant, they acknowledge the responsibility for the accident and that it was their
Line 377, 16:07:15: fault. The case is for you to determine the appropriate damages. The injury is severe, and they ask for an
Line 378, 16:07:15: extraordinary amount of compensation.
Line 379, 16:07:15: She broke her ankle, which was repaired surgically with plates and screws. There was a second surgery
Line 380, 16:07:15: due to loosening of the screws, which were then removed. She attended physical therapy, which
Line 381, 16:07:15: improved her ability to move her ankle. Whether she will need surgery in the future is uncertain.
Line 382, 16:07:15: The past medical expenses are around $36,505, which we don’t contest. Her lost wages due to the
Line 383, 16:07:15: accident are around $3,400 to $3,500. These are not the focal points of this case. The main issue is the
Line 384, 16:07:15: amount to be awarded for non-economic damages, for which we request something fair, reasonable,
Line 385, 16:07:15: and sensible.
Line 386, 16:07:15: Thank you for your time and attention, and we hope to conclude this case promptly.
Line 387, 16:07:15: Testimony of Victim’s Husband
Line 388, 16:07:15: Mr. Miller: Good morning. Can I have your address?
Line 389, 16:07:15: SJ: Certainly.
Line 390, 16:07:15: Mr. Miller: How long have you lived at that address?
--- End of Page 12 ---

--- Beginning of Page 13 ---
Line 391, 16:07:16: SJ: I bought the house in 2003, so it’s been approximately ten years.
Line 392, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Who lives there with you?
Line 393, 16:07:16: SJ: My wife, and our four children.
Line 394, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Can you tell the jury how old your children are and their names?
Line 395, 16:07:16: SJ: Yes. My children are 13, and the others are…
Line 396, 16:07:16: The Honorable Judge: Please continue.
Line 397, 16:07:16: SJ: …five, and three.
Line 398, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: I understand. And for some background, what do you do for a living?
Line 399, 16:07:16: SJ: I’m currently the general manager at Oreck Clean Home Center.
Line 400, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: And where are these locations?
Line 401, 16:07:16: SJ: We have six locations in Maryland and Virginia.
Line 402, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: What are your responsibilities at work?
Line 403, 16:07:16: SJ: I oversee all six stores and manage one of them.
Line 404, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Can you describe your work schedule?
Line 405, 16:07:16: SJ: I work Monday through Saturday, from 10:00 am to 7:00 pm. Often, I work seven days a week which
Line 406, 16:07:16: means working on Sundays from 12:00 pm to 5:00 pm.
Line 407, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: How do you feel about those hours?
Line 408, 16:07:16: SJ: They are long, but I need to work to support my family.
Line 409, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: How long have you known your wife?
Line 410, 16:07:16: SJ: I met her in 1993, she was my sister’s best friend.
Line 411, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: You mean your wife was your sister’s best friend?
Line 412, 16:07:16: SJ: Yes, I apologize for the confusion. She was indeed my sister’s best friend.
Line 413, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Let’s move to another topic. Do you remember the car accident your wife was in 2022?
Line 414, 16:07:16: SJ: Yes, I do.
Line 415, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Prior to the accident, can you describe your household?
Line 416, 16:07:16: SJ: Our household was what I would consider the perfect life. My wife and children were happy and
Line 417, 16:07:16: always engaged in activities. We used to take vacations and attend family reunions.
Line 418, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Was your wife a spontaneous person or a planner?
Line 419, 16:07:16: SJ: She was more spontaneous, always ready to take on new activities.
--- End of Page 13 ---

--- Beginning of Page 14 ---
Line 420, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Could you describe her for the jury?
Line 421, 16:07:16: SJ: She is always happy, loves socializing and helping people. She attended choir rehearsal, Bible study
Line 422, 16:07:16: every week, and also took care of our four children.
Line 423, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: What was her job at the time of the crash?
Line 424, 16:07:16: SJ: She was the assistant manager of a hair salon.
Line 425, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Did she enjoy her work?
Line 426, 16:07:16: SJ: Yes, she loved her work. It was part of her identity.
Line 427, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Did your wife’s demeanor change after the car accident?
Line 428, 16:07:16: SJ: Yes, after the accident everything changed. Our family life and activity level changed significantly. She
Line 429, 16:07:16: used to take the children to sporting events and practice basketball. Now, she can’t do these activities.
Line 430, 16:07:16: She no longer goes on family vacations. My two older sons call her “boring” now because of her reduced
Line 431, 16:07:16: activity level. The accident has restricted her capabilities and as a result, she can’t even do simple tasks
Line 432, 16:07:16: like carrying laundry baskets or standing up to cook. Our family life has changed drastically since the
Line 433, 16:07:16: accident.
Line 434, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Has your wife gone back to work since the accident?
Line 435, 16:07:16: SJ: She tried to help a friend out a couple of months ago at her hair salon, but it ended with her in a lot
Line 436, 16:07:16: of pain due to the swelling in her ankle.
Line 437, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: I have here a picture you received from your wife. Is this the picture she sent you?
Line 438, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Can you tell us how your wife’s personal social life has been affected since the crash?
Line 439, 16:07:16: SJ: Her social life has indeed changed significantly. Before the accident, she would regularly go out with
Line 440, 16:07:16: friends, engage in dancing, and other social activities. However, the constant pain and discomfort after
Line 441, 16:07:16: the crash have made such activities impossible. Her social life is definitely not the same as before.
Line 442, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: You mentioned earlier about her job. Was she able to resume work post the crash?
Line 443, 16:07:16: SJ: She attempted to return to work, but the persistent pain made it unmanageable, particularly the
Line 444, 16:07:16: long-standing hours. Eventually, she was forced to leave her job.
Line 445, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: How has this situation impacted your family’s finances?
Line 446, 16:07:16: SJ: The impact has been substantial. She held the position of an assistant manager at a hair salon,
Line 447, 16:07:16: bringing in a significant income. Now, with my single income, managing expenses for our four children
Line 448, 16:07:16: and her medical bills has been strenuous.
Line 449, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Besides the financial struggle, can you share how your relationship with your wife has
Line 450, 16:07:16: evolved post the accident?
Line 451, 16:07:16: SJ: Our relationship has undeniably been affected. She isn’t the same person she was before the crash.
Line 452, 16:07:16: Her constant pain and fatigue, coupled with frustration, have been hard on both of us.
Line 453, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: And your children? How have they been coping with all these changes?
--- End of Page 14 ---

--- Beginning of Page 15 ---
Line 454, 16:07:16: SJ: Our children have had to make significant adjustments. They miss the mother they had before the
Line 455, 16:07:16: crash, not understanding why she can’t engage in the activities she used to do with them. My older
Line 456, 16:07:16: sons, in particular, have had to step up, assisting more with household chores. It’s been a lot for them
Line 457, 16:07:16: too.
Line 458, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Finally, could you share your hopes for your wife’s future?
Line 459, 16:07:16: SJ: My biggest hope is for her to find relief from her pain and regain some semblance of normalcy. She
Line 460, 16:07:16: deserves to live her life, not just endure it. It’s challenging to see such a wonderful person go through
Line 461, 16:07:16: this. We are taking each day as it comes, hoping for a better future.
Line 462, 16:07:16: Defense Attorney Cross Examination of Victim’s Husband
Line 463, 16:07:16: Q: Regarding the foot stretching exercises, you assist her with those?
Line 464, 16:07:16: A: Yes, I do.
Line 465, 16:07:16: Q: Looking through her medical records, I noticed there’s mention of an exercise bike at home. Do you
Line 466, 16:07:16: have one?
Line 467, 16:07:16: A: Indeed, we do have an exercise bike at home.
Line 468, 16:07:16: Q: Did she frequently use the exercise bike, especially post-accident?
Line 469, 16:07:16: A: Initially, during her therapy, they had her try riding the exercise bike.
Line 470, 16:07:16: Q: Can you tell us what kind of exercises she did at home after the accident?
Line 471, 16:07:16: A: She was given a chart with exercises, and I’ve been helping her to flex her foot in both directions to
Line 472, 16:07:16: try and loosen it up.
Line 473, 16:07:16: Q: How long did this routine last?
Line 474, 16:07:16: A: Actually, I still assist her with the foot exercises every night.
Line 475, 16:07:16: Q: So you assist her based on the instructions from the chart?
Line 476, 16:07:16: A: Not directly from the chart, but I’ve learned the correct angles and try to flex her foot every night for
Line 477, 16:07:16: her comfort and to aid her sleep.
Line 478, 16:07:16: Q: Does she drive?
Line 479, 16:07:16: A: Yes, she does.
Line 480, 16:07:16: Q: Prior to the accident, she was employed full time?
