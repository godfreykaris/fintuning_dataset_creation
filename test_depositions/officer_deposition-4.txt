Line 18, 16:06:50: that happened on September 19, 2013.

Line 2, 16:06:50: you don't hear it or you don't understand it, please
Line 3, 16:06:50: tell me that and I'll repeat the question for you or
Line 4, 16:06:50: I'll ask it a different way.
Line 5, 16:06:50: You were sworn today with the same oath
Line 6, 16:06:50: that you would take at the trial of this case. So,
Line 7, 16:06:50: if you answer any question for us today, we all
Line 8, 16:06:50: shall take it that you heard the question and that
Line 9, 16:06:50: you understood it and that you then gave your swor
Line 10, 16:06:50: answer; is all of that clear?
Line 11, 16:06:50: A Yes.
Line 12, 16:06:50: Q Have you ever had your deposition taken
Line 13, 16:06:50: before in an official capacity?
Line 14, 16:06:50: A Yes.

Line 4, 16:06:50: 7
Line 5, 16:06:50: A Two or three, to the best of my
Line 6, 16:06:50: recollection.
Line 7, 16:06:50: Q Have you ever testified in court with
Line 8, 16:06:50: regard to a motor vehicle accident and your
Line 9, 16:06:50: investigation of it?
Line 10, 16:06:50: F 6 A Yes.
Line 11, 16:06:50: Q Did you testify as a fact witness or an
Line 12, 16:06:50: expert witness --
Line 13, 16:06:50: A Yes.
Line 14, 16:06:50: Q -- or both?
Line 15, 16:06:50: A Expert.
Line 16, 16:06:50: Q And what area of expertise were you
Line 17, 16:06:50: qualified in in that case?
Line 18, 16:06:50: A Crash reconstruction.
Line 19, 16:06:50: Q Can you tell us your background as far as
Line 20, 16:06:50: your training and experience in crash reconstruction
Line 21, 16:06:50: investigation?
Line 22, 16:06:50: A I have a Bachelor of Science -- well, I
Line 23, 16:06:50: have a bachelor's degree in physics from
Line 24, 16:06:50: Randolph-Macon and 14 years in the police department
Line 25, 16:06:50: and eight years on the crash team.
Line 26, 16:06:50: I have -- I don't recall the exact hours,
--- End of Page 11 ---

--- Beginning of Page 12 ---
Line 1, 16:06:50: 8
Line 2, 16:06:50: but it's over 200, a couple hundred hours of
Line 3, 16:06:50: training with like Levels 1, 2, 3, pedestrian,
Line 4, 16:06:50: motorcycle, crush -- I mean, there's a multitude of
Line 5, 16:06:50: schools. Again, I can't remember them all right
Line 6, 16:06:50: now.
Line 7, 16:06:50: Q Was some of that training with the
Line 8, 16:06:50: police department?
Line 9, 16:06:50: A Except for the college degree, all of the
Line 10, 16:06:50: other training was with the police department.
Line 11, 16:06:50: Q And you have conducted accident
Line 12, 16:06:50: reconstruction investigations in your career as a
Line 13, 16:06:50: police officer, I take?
Line 14, 16:06:50: A Yes.
Line 15, 16:06:50: Q How many have you done where you were the
Line 16, 16:06:50: lead investigator, if you will, approximately?
Line 17, 16:06:50: A I'm thinking. Usually I write around 30
Line 18, 16:06:50: reports a year, and I've been doing it for eight
Line 19, 16:06:50: years, so that's --
Line 20, 16:06:50: Q A lot of reports?
Line 21, 16:06:50: A I mean, with actual reconstruction, maybe
Line 22, 16:06:50: 200.
Line 23, 16:06:50: Q And you're approximating?

Line 10, 16:06:50: A No.

Line 20, 16:06:50: Q But you were the lead?
Line 21, 16:06:50: A Uh-huh; yes.
Line 22, 16:06:50: Q Were you the first officer upon the scene
Line 23, 16:06:50: that day?

Line 4, 16:06:50: Q Exhibit 1 in the deposition is your -- is
Line 5, 16:06:50: the state of Maryland Motor Vehicle Accident Repo
Line 6, 16:06:50: No. .
Line 7, 16:06:50: Is that a report you had any hand in
Line 8, 16:06:50: preparing?
Line 9, 16:06:50: A Yes.
Line 10, 16:06:50: Q What was your involvement in preparing
Line 11, 16:06:50: that report that's Exhibit 1?
Line 12, 16:06:50: A I wrote the report.
Line 13, 16:06:50: Q Did anyone else give you input into the
Line 14, 16:06:50: report as far as police officer personnel go, not
Line 15, 16:06:50: fact witnesses?
Line 16, 16:06:50: A I don't recall.
Line 17, 16:06:50: Q The incident is reported on Exhibit 1 as
Line 18, 16:06:50: happening on September 19, 2013, at 1800 hours.
Line 19, 16:06:50: Is that in accord with your recollection?
Line 20, 16:06:50: A Honestly, I don't -- it was over three
Line 21, 16:06:50: years ago. I don't recall every detail. That's why
Line 22, 16:06:50: I write the report. So, if it's on the report,

Line 4, 16:06:50: 11
Line 5, 16:06:50: that's what happened.
Line 6, 16:06:50: Q I guess I should ask you this
Line 7, 16:06:50: question first. Do you have -- as you sit here
Line 8, 16:06:50: today, do you have any independent recollection of
Line 9, 16:06:50: the incident that's documented on Exhibit 1?
Line 10, 16:06:50: A Honestly, the only thing I remember is, I
Line 11, 16:06:50: believe this is the same crash, the guy had dog poop
Line 12, 16:06:50: on his shoe and that's how we got an AOI. It's like
Line 13, 16:06:50: the smear mark of dirt on the road is the only thing
Line 14, 16:06:50: I really remember about the crash because it was
Line 15, 16:06:50: odd. It's like one of those random things. It
Line 16, 16:06:50: never happens, and it happened.
Line 17, 16:06:50: Q And the AOI is what?
Line 18, 16:06:50: A Area of impact. I apologize.
Line 19, 16:06:50: Q So you do recall that because it's an
Line 20, 16:06:50: unusual fact.
Line 21, 16:06:50: Do you recall independently anything else
Line 22, 16:06:50: about your investigation?
Line 23, 16:06:50: A No.
Line 24, 16:06:50: Q And it would assist you to look at your
Line 25, 16:06:50: report, I take it, and your papers as you are
Line 26, 16:06:50: testifying?

Line 2, 16:06:50: A Yes.
Line 3, 16:06:50: Q Okay. So please feel free to do so.
Line 4, 16:06:50: You arrived on the scene, and you do
Line 5, 16:06:50: remember you weren't the first officer on the scene?
Line 6, 16:06:50: , 5 A I wouldn't have been the first officer.
Line 7, 16:06:50: My unit is called secondary. After it is deemed the
Line 8, 16:06:50: person is injured enough and they are going to a
Line 9, 16:06:50: trauma center and have a certain amount of injuries,
Line 10, 16:06:50: we are called in to do the investigation.
Line 11, 16:06:50: Q So you know you weren't the first officer
Line 12, 16:06:50: on the scene because of that fact?
Line 13, 16:06:50: A Yes.
Line 14, 16:06:50: Q When you arrived at the scene, do you have
Line 15, 16:06:50: any recollection of getting there and what you saw
Line 16, 16:06:50: when you got there?
Line 17, 16:06:50: A No.
Line 18, 16:06:50: Q What would have been your protocol back on
Line 19, 16:06:50: September 19, 2013, to investigate an accident of
Line 20, 16:06:50: this nature?
Line 21, 16:06:50: You received a call saying it was a car
Line 22, 16:06:50: and a pedestrian; did you have that much
Line 23, 16:06:50: information?

Line 3, 16:06:52: A If we -- if the crash came up, the police
Line 4, 16:06:52: responded, and patrol units would request the crash
Line 5, 16:06:52: team and we responded, we would go to the scene an
Line 6, 16:06:52: I guess, get out and talk to witnesses, analyze the
Line 7, 16:06:52: scene, take measurements and photographs, and
Line 8, 16:06:52: respond to the hospital. I guess that's normal
Line 9, 16:06:52: protocol.
Line 10, 16:06:52: Q When you arrived, were you alone?
Line 11, 16:06:52: A I don't recall.
Line 12, 16:06:52: Q What would have been the practice; would
Line 13, 16:06:52: you have been alone or would you have had someone
Line 14, 16:06:52: with you?
Line 15, 16:06:52: A Usually, it's one officer per car, and we
Line 16, 16:06:52: work the entire county so it's not -- other people
Line 17, 16:06:52: could have been other places in the county and they
Line 18, 16:06:52: all go to the crash so we respond at different
Line 19, 16:06:52: times. So I don't recall.
Line 20, 16:06:52: Q What equipment did you have with you; did
Line 21, 16:06:52: you have a digital camera?
Line 22, 16:06:52: A For the unit, yes, because we use a
Line 23, 16:06:52: digital camera for pictures, but each car has
Line 24, 16:06:52: different equipment in it. I mean, usually it's
--- End of Page 5 ---

--- Beginning of Page 6 ---
Line 1, 16:06:52: measuring equipment, like a wheelie-walker, ta
Line 2, 16:06:52: measures, levels, that kind of thing. But, as in
Line 3, 16:06:52: who brought the camera that was used, I don't
Line 4, 16:06:52: recall.
Line 5, 16:06:52: Q Did you take the pictures?
Line 6, 16:06:52: A I don't recall if I did or not.
Line 7, 16:06:52: Q The pictures that are marked as Exhibit 2
Line 8, 16:06:52: and they are subtitled A through M, do you recogni
Line 9, 16:06:52: those as pictures from this file?
Line 10, 16:06:52: A Yes. The only the thing I'd say is that's
Line 11, 16:06:52: my arm --
Line 12, 16:06:52: Q Okay.
Line 13, 16:06:52: A -- on J.
Line 14, 16:06:52: Q On Exhibit 2J, you recognize your arm, and
Line 15, 16:06:52: it's the exhibit of the hand holding the shoe?
Line 16, 16:06:52: A Yes. So, by that, I would surmise that I
Line 17, 16:06:52: took the pictures.
Line 18, 16:06:52: Q When you arrived at the scene, do you have
Line 19, 16:06:52: any recollection of speaking with the operator of
Line 20, 16:06:52: the motor vehicle identified as Lisa Michelle
Line 21, 16:06:52: Barracato?

Line 18, 16:06:52: does that refresh you; would you say, oh, yeah, I
Line 19, 16:06:52: spoke with the lady or I spoke with the man?
Line 20, 16:06:52: A If I wrote in the report that I spoke to
Line 21, 16:06:52: the individual, then I spoke to them. In this
Line 22, 16:06:52: instance, both of them completed written statements
Line 23, 16:06:52: and I just copied their written statements. So, by
Line 24, 16:06:52: that, I would say, no, I did not talk to them.
Line 25, 16:06:52: Q What would have been the practice back
Line 26, 16:06:52: then; normally, would you speak with witnesses or

Line 1, 16:06:52: 16
Line 2, 16:06:52: e 1 would one of your subordinates speak with the
Line 3, 16:06:52: witnesses?
Line 4, 16:06:52: A When we arrive at a scene, we all take
Line 5, 16:06:52: different jobs just to facilitate, I guess, handling
Line 6, 16:06:52: the crash quicker to open up the roadway. So
Line 7, 16:06:52: somebody does pictures, somebody does measurements,
Line 8, 16:06:52: somebody talks to witnesses, somebody talks to the
Line 9, 16:06:52: e 8 drivers. So the jobs get shuffled up every time we
Line 10, 16:06:52: go.
Line 11, 16:06:52: Q So you can't say who would have done --
Line 12, 16:06:52: A Yeah.
Line 13, 16:06:52: Q -- that task on September 19, 2013?
Line 14, 16:06:52: A No.
Line 15, 16:06:52: Q There is a statement from the driver which
Line 16, 16:06:52: is part of Exhibit 1, the second to last page, and
Line 17, 16:06:52: then also from a witness named Grant Baber. You're
Line 18, 16:06:52: looking at those statements right now.
Line 19, 16:06:52: Looking at them, does that assist at all,
Line 20, 16:06:52: jog your memory, as to whether you were involved in
Line 21, 16:06:52: the completion of this statement?
Line 22, 16:06:52: A By completion of the statement, what do
Line 23, 16:06:52: you mean, like taking the statement from the

Line 3, 16:06:52: individual?
Line 4, 16:06:52: Q Yes.
Line 5, 16:06:52: A No, it doesn't. I would say, like, our
Line 6, 16:06:52: normal protocol is I don't take the statement, but
Line 7, 16:06:52: my name is on the long form because that's -- they
Line 8, 16:06:52: all have to filled out. Since it's my report, I get
Line 9, 16:06:52: all the statements and I just put my name on them
Line 10, 16:06:52: Q Understood.
Line 11, 16:06:52: A -- before we turn in the report.
Line 12, 16:06:52: Q Okay. That's why I was asking.
Line 13, 16:06:52: So I know you don't have any independent
Line 14, 16:06:52: recollection of this specific accident, but take me
Line 15, 16:06:52: through the steps that you would go through when
Line 16, 16:06:52: investigating an accident of this nature back at
Line 17, 16:06:52: that time.
Line 18, 16:06:52: A Um --
Line 19, 16:06:52: Q Just in summary form. You don't have to
Line 20, 16:06:52: go into great detail.
Line 21, 16:06:52: A I respond to the scene, and I get out.
Line 22, 16:06:52: Usually I walk the scene to get an idea of what
Line 23, 16:06:52: happened, if there's any evidence on the road,
Line 24, 16:06:52: damage to the car, see if there are witnesses.
--- End of Page 9 ---

--- Beginning of Page 10 ---
Line 1, 16:06:52: Then it's take notes of the car, note any
Line 2, 16:06:52: vehicle damage, take photographs of the car,
Line 3, 16:06:52: photograph the scene, make note of any evidence i
Line 4, 16:06:52: the roadway of either shoe scuffs, hats, shoes,
Line 5, 16:06:52: blood.
Line 6, 16:06:52: Then measure the scene, measure the
Line 7, 16:06:52: evidence that we found, and talk to the witnesses
Line 8, 16:06:52: and drivers, if they are available and at the scene.
Line 9, 16:06:52: Then, once the on-scene investigation is complete,
Line 10, 16:06:52: then usually it's respond to the hospital and speak
Line 11, 16:06:52: to the individuals involved.
Line 12, 16:06:52: Q And you don't have any recollection of
Line 13, 16:06:52: going to the hospital and speaking with
Line 14, 16:06:52: ?
Line 15, 16:06:52: A No.
Line 16, 16:06:52: Q Exhibit 2 is the photographs taken at the
Line 17, 16:06:52: scene, we believe. The third picture, photo C
Line 18, 16:06:52: labeled down in the corner, shows -- it looks like
Line 19, 16:06:52: an officer is in the vehicle I presume trying to get
Line 20, 16:06:52: data from the hookup in the vehicle.

Line 6, 16:06:52: A By the boots, I cannot.
Line 7, 16:06:52: Q Do you have an idea what that individual
Line 8, 16:06:52: is doing in that photograph?
Line 9, 16:06:52: A Probably either making note of what's
Line 10, 16:06:52: going on inside the car or trying to hook up the EDR
Line 11, 16:06:52: -- 7 to do an image of the air bag monitor.
Line 12, 16:06:52: Q Do you know if any EDR data was downloaded
Line 13, 16:06:52: for this crash in that vehicle?
Line 14, 16:06:52: A The only thing I can say is if it's not in
Line 15, 16:06:52: the report -- I mean, if it's in the report, it was
Line 16, 16:06:52: done. If it's not in the report, it didn't get
Line 17, 16:06:52: done. Because sometimes you can download a car and,
Line 18, 16:06:52: if it's not severe enough, it doesn't record
Line 19, 16:06:52: anything.
Line 20, 16:06:52: Q I know you don't have great
Line 21, 16:06:52: recollection -- independent recollection because of
Line 22, 16:06:52: the number of crashes you investigate, but when you
Line 23, 16:06:52: arrived do you recall if the motor vehicle was in
Line 24, 16:06:52: the general vicinity that is shown on photograph 2A?
Line 25, 16:06:52: A The only the thing I can testify to is
Line 26, 16:06:52: that it is, I guess, protocol that if we're called
--- End of Page 11 ---

--- Beginning of Page 12 ---
Line 1, 16:06:52: 20
Line 2, 16:06:52: the scene is left alone. So cars are not supposed
Line 3, 16:06:52: to be moved before our arrival; and, if they are, we
Line 4, 16:06:52: are noted, like we are given notation.
Line 5, 16:06:52: Q And you don't have any notation that this
Line 6, 16:06:52: vehicle was moved before you arrived on the scene?
Line 7, 16:06:52: A Correct.
Line 8, 16:06:52: Q There were cones set up as shown in
Line 9, 16:06:52: photograph 2A.
Line 10, 16:06:52: Would those be cones you would have placed
Line 11, 16:06:52: just from your practice or would they have been put
Line 12, 16:06:52: there before you arrived?
Line 13, 16:06:52: A I would say it's standard practice for a
Line 14, 16:06:52: patrol to cone items, especially in pedestrian
Line 15, 16:06:52: crashes, that are of interest, shoes, hats, and
Line 16, 16:06:52: that. So they know, if somehow somebody kicks it
Line 17, 16:06:52: and it's moved, they still have the general area of
Line 18, 16:06:52: where it was.
Line 19, 16:06:52: So we usually do not put down cones. I
Line 20, 16:06:52: mean, it has happened in the past, but as a general
Line 21, 16:06:52: practice usually a patrol does it.
Line 22, 16:06:52: Q On page 2 of Exhibit 1, which is the
Line 23, 16:06:52: police report, in the middle of the page there's a

Line 3, 16:06:52: heading, quote, Part 2: Observations (of the
Line 4, 16:06:52: investigator).
Line 5, 16:06:52: Are you the investigator referred to
Line 6, 16:06:52: there?
Line 7, 16:06:52: A Yes.
Line 8, 16:06:52: Q So those were your observations in the
Line 9, 16:06:52: narration underneath part 2?
Line 10, 16:06:52: A Yes.
Line 11, 16:06:52: Q Let's go down to the one thing that you do
Line 12, 16:06:52: specifically recall because it was unusual and that
Line 13, 16:06:52: is the dirt mark in the road.
Line 14, 16:06:52: Was it dirt or was it, in fact, dog feces
Line 15, 16:06:52: or a combination of both?
Line 16, 16:06:52: A I think it was a combination of both
Line 17, 16:06:52: because it was unusual. Shoe scuffs are very har
Line 18, 16:06:52: to find and to have one on scene is kind of -- it's
Line 19, 16:06:52: a rarity. The dirt on the shoe makes the shoe
Line 20, 16:06:52: scuff. Like I said, that's the only thing I
Line 21, 16:06:52: remember from the crash.
Line 22, 16:06:52: Q Fair enough. How did you determine that
Line 23, 16:06:52: the -- strike that.
Line 24, 16:06:52: There's a photo in Exhibit 2, subphoto D,
--- End of Page 13 ---

Line 1, 16:06:52: the fourth one down.
Line 2, 16:06:52: Is that a photo of the transfer of the
Line 3, 16:06:52: dirt or dog feces to the roadway that you're talking
Line 4, 16:06:52: about remembering?
Line 5, 16:06:52: A Yes.
Line 6, 16:06:52: Q And it's your opinion that shows what?
Line 7, 16:06:52: A It shows where the shoe was located when
Line 8, 16:06:52: it was, I guess, abruptly moved sideways. That
Line 9, 16:06:52: would be considered the AOI, area of impact.
Line 10, 16:06:52: Q Going on down, photo J is the shoe, and
Line 11, 16:06:52: we've already commented you remember that's you ho
Line 12, 16:06:52: the shoe there?
Line 13, 16:06:52: A Uh-huh.
Line 14, 16:06:52: Q Did you take that photograph or would
Line 15, 16:06:52: someone else have taken it?
Line 16, 16:06:52: A I would have taken it.
Line 17, 16:06:52: Q Okay. In determining that the transfer of
Line 18, 16:06:52: the soil to the roadway was the point of impact, did
Line 19, 16:06:52: you use any calculations or was it just your
Line 20, 16:06:52: reckoning from what you saw?
Line 21, 16:06:52: In other words, did you use any analysis
Line 22, 16:06:52: to arrive at that or was it just from a visual

Line 5, 16:06:52: inspection and a deduction-type conclusion?
Line 6, 16:06:52: A From my experience in doing crash
Line 7, 16:06:52: reconstruction, when you have a shoe scuff, that's
Line 8, 16:06:52: the area of impact. It's where the pedestrian was
Line 9, 16:06:52: standing when he was struck by the vehicle.
Line 10, 16:06:52: Q Did you measure where that scuff mark is
Line 11, 16:06:52: in reference to any point?
Line 12, 16:06:52: A Yes.

Line 16, 16:06:52: Q On page 5, in the middle of the page, it
Line 17, 16:06:52: says, quote, area of impact, dash, 29 feet, 11
Line 18, 16:06:52: inches east and 8 feet, 11 inches north of the
Line 19, 16:06:52: reference point; is that what you're looking at?
Line 20, 16:06:52: A Yes.
Line 21, 16:06:52: Q Up above that writing on page 5 of Exhibit
Line 22, 16:06:52: 1 is your description of what you used as the
Line 23, 16:06:52: reference points.
Line 24, 16:06:52: Can you read that part into the record?
Line 25, 16:06:52: A The east curb of Beechfield Avenue and the
Line 26, 16:06:52: south curb of Wilkens Avenue were used as reference

Line 1, 16:06:52: 24
Line 2, 16:06:52: points for the following measurements.
Line 3, 16:06:52: Q Okay. And then you measured the road
Line 4, 16:06:52: dimensions of Wilkens Avenue?
Line 5, 16:06:52: A Yes.
Line 6, 16:06:52: Q And that's not using the reference points.
Line 7, 16:06:52: That's just measuring the roadway; correct?
Line 8, 16:06:52: A Yes.
Line 9, 16:06:52: Q Then, beneath that, you have measurements
Line 10, 16:06:52: of the wheel position of all four wheels of the
Line 11, 16:06:52: vehicle.
Line 12, 16:06:52: d 11 Are those measurements taken with regard
Line 13, 16:06:52: to the reference points?
Line 14, 16:06:52: A Yes.
Line 15, 16:06:52: Q Can you show me maybe using page 9 of the
Line 16, 16:06:52: report, the page with the diagram -- is it possible
Line 17, 16:06:52: to show me or show us, because we have some
Line 18, 16:06:52: confusion, where those reference points are, if we
Line 19, 16:06:52: come around and take a look?
Line 20, 16:06:52: A Okay.

Line 11, 16:06:52: Q We're talking about the reference points
Line 12, 16:06:52: that you used in Exhibit 1 to take some
Line 13, 16:06:52: measurements. I'm showing you now what is marked

Line 18, 16:06:52: at the scene or at some point later?
Line 19, 16:06:52: A At the scene.
Line 20, 16:06:52: Q Can you show us on Exhibit 3 the reference
Line 21, 16:06:52: points you're using when you say you're using the
Line 22, 16:06:52: east curb of Beechfield Avenue and the south curb of

Line 1, 16:06:52: curb of Wilkens.
Line 2, 16:06:52: Q Okay. And then you have drawn in a
Line 3, 16:06:52: rectangle which depicts the approximate place of the
Line 4, 16:06:52: vehicle?
Line 5, 16:06:52: A Yes.
Line 6, 16:06:52: Q And you have drawn in a stick figure that
Line 7, 16:06:52: depicts the approximate place of the resting point
Line 8, 16:06:52: for the pedestrian?
Line 9, 16:06:52: A Yes.
Line 10, 16:06:52: Q And you have drawn in a dark line along
Line 11, 16:06:52: the curbing.
Line 12, 16:06:52: Does that indicate the sewer grate?
Line 13, 16:06:52: A No. That's just a reference for myself to
Line 14, 16:06:52: know what curbs I used as reference points.
Line 15, 16:06:52: Q Okay. So the two dark lines along the
Line 16, 16:06:52: curbing are just indications of that's the reference

Line 18, 16:06:52: A Yes.

Line 11, 16:06:52: A Yes.
Line 12, 16:06:52: Q Okay. Was there anything else that
Line 13, 16:06:52: factored into your determination of the AOI other
Line 14, 16:06:52: than, essentially, the dead reckoning of seeing the
Line 15, 16:06:52: s 11 scuff mark on the road versus the shoe?
Line 16, 16:06:52: A The one thing I would say is that it
Line 17, 16:06:52: coincides with the damage on the vehicle. It kind
Line 18, 16:06:52: . 14 of lined up in the middle of the vehicle. The
Line 19, 16:06:52: damage lined up in the middle of the vehicle so it
Line 20, 16:06:52: all -- I would say they coincided with each other.
Line 21, 16:06:52: Q The area of the resting place for the
Line 22, 16:06:52: pedestrian, did any calculations go into that other
Line 23, 16:06:52: than the fact that that's where the blood was, the
Line 24, 16:06:52: pool of blood, which I think is shown in one of the

Line 1, 16:06:52: 28
Line 2, 16:06:52: of the final resting point of the pedestrian other
Line 3, 16:06:52: than the pool of blood?
Line 4, 16:06:52: A Calculation or measurement?
Line 5, 16:06:52: Because the resting point was not
Line 6, 16:06:52: calculated, but measured.
Line 7, 16:06:52: Q And it was measured from the reference

Line 9, 16:06:52: A Yes.
Line 10, 16:06:52: Q I understand.
Line 11, 16:06:52: Did you have any idea of the speed of the
Line 12, 16:06:52: vehicle just from what you saw there?
Line 13, 16:06:52: A From my experience, it looked like a
Line 14, 16:06:52: low-speed impact.
Line 15, 16:06:52: Q And were you basing that on the damage to
Line 16, 16:06:52: the motor vehicle?
Line 17, 16:06:52: A It's the damage to the motor vehicle and
Line 18, 16:06:52: the distance from where the pedestrian was struck to
Line 19, 16:06:52: where they came to final rest. The higher the
Line 20, 16:06:52: speed, the greater the distance.
Line 21, 16:06:52: Q And I would presume the more damage to the
Line 22, 16:06:52: car --
Line 23, 16:06:52: A Yes.

Line 3, 16:06:52: Q -- likely as well?
Line 4, 16:06:52: You hadn't done the calculations to come
Line 5, 16:06:52: up with the approximate speed the vehicle was goin
Line 6, 16:06:52: at the scene. Just eyeballing it, your conclusion
Line 7, 16:06:52: was, well, this wasn't a high-speed impact?
Line 8, 16:06:52: A Correct.
Line 9, 16:06:52: Q And you don't recall the driver of the
Line 10, 16:06:52: vehicle saying anything to you as far as what her
Line 11, 16:06:52: speed was?
Line 12, 16:06:52: A No.
Line 13, 16:06:52: Q There is a statement by the witness, Grant
Line 14, 16:06:52: Baber, on the last page of Exhibit 1 where he states
Line 15, 16:06:52: or writes that the vehicle, the black SUV, was
Line 16, 16:06:52: "traveling at a high rate of speed."
Line 17, 16:06:52: Did you attach any significance to that
Line 18, 16:06:52: statement?
Line 19, 16:06:52: A No.
Line 20, 16:06:52: Q Why not?
Line 21, 16:06:52: A Most witnesses have a false perception of
Line 22, 16:06:52: speed.
Line 23, 16:06:52: Q Do you remember speaking with Mr. Baber
Line 24, 16:06:52: A No.
--- End of Page 9 ---

--- Beginning of Page 10 ---
Line 1, 16:06:52: Q Mr. Baber also writes "he -- meaning the
Line 2, 16:06:52: pedestrian -- was in the crosswalk at the time."
Line 3, 16:06:52: Did you attach any significance to that
Line 4, 16:06:52: statement?
Line 5, 16:06:52: A No.
Line 6, 16:06:52: Q Why not?
Line 7, 16:06:52: A Well, the area of the impact put the -- I
Line 8, 16:06:52: mean, the shoe scuff put the area of impact outsi
Line 9, 16:06:52: of a crosswalk. So pedestrians have -- not
Line 10, 16:06:52: pedestrians, excuse me, witnesses don't have the
Line 11, 16:06:52: best recollections.
Line 12, 16:06:52: Q Was there a crosswalk at the intersection
Line 13, 16:06:52: there where the accident occurred, where this
Line 14, 16:06:52: pedestrian was crossing?
Line 15, 16:06:52: A For Wilkens Avenue where the crash
Line 16, 16:06:52: occurred there was no crosswalk.
Line 17, 16:06:52: Q Are you saying there were no painted
Line 18, 16:06:52: crosswalk lines on the roadway?
Line 19, 16:06:52: A No.
Line 20, 16:06:52: Q That's correct, there were no painted
Line 21, 16:06:52: crosswalk lines on the roadway?
Line 22, 16:06:52: A Correct.

Line 5, 16:06:52: Q Go ahead.
Line 6, 16:06:52: A If I recall, there were some on the west
Line 7, 16:06:52: part of the intersection. There was a crosswalk to
Line 8, 16:06:52: cross Wilkens Avenue.
Line 9, 16:06:52: Q Is there such a thing in Maryland law as
Line 10, 16:06:52: an unmarked crosswalk?
Line 11, 16:06:52: A There is. I think it's called an implied
Line 12, 16:06:52: crosswalk.
Line 13, 16:06:52: Q And what's an implied crosswalk?
Line 14, 16:06:52: A I don't have the definition.
Line 15, 16:06:52: Q What's the general understanding?
Line 16, 16:06:52: I'm not holding you to the words of any
Line 17, 16:06:52: statute, but what is your understanding of the
Line 18, 16:06:52: implied crosswalk?
Line 19, 16:06:52: A Where you have -- the sidewalk comes down
Line 20, 16:06:52: and the curb is lowered for ease of, I guess,
Line 21, 16:06:52: getting off the curb to go onto the street. When
Line 22, 16:06:52: you have that but no crosswalk, like no painted
Line 23, 16:06:52: crosswalk, that would be implied.
Line 24, 16:06:52: Q So a pedestrian crossing there would be
Line 25, 16:06:52: entitled to the protections of a crosswalk even
Line 26, 16:06:52: though there's none painted on the roadway?

Line 3, 16:06:52: Q How wide is your standard crosswalk when
Line 4, 16:06:52: one is painted on the roadway?
Line 5, 16:06:52: A I don't know the specific dimensions, but
Line 6, 16:06:52: usually I would say eight to ten feet.
Line 7, 16:06:52: Q And you're approximating?
Line 8, 16:06:52: A It's an approximation.
Line 9, 16:06:52: e 8 Q In your experience, are they usually
Line 10, 16:06:52: uniform sizes when they're painted or do they vary
Line 11, 16:06:52: in what you've seen?
Line 12, 16:06:52: A They vary.
Line 13, 16:06:52: Q Do you know where Mr. entered
Line 14, 16:06:52: the roadway of Wilkens Avenue?
Line 15, 16:06:52: A As in?
Line 16, 16:06:52: Q Can you identify within a few feet where
Line 17, 16:06:52: he entered the roadway?
Line 18, 16:06:52: A No.
Line 19, 16:06:52: Q Is your understanding of where he was, at
Line 20, 16:06:52: least when the contact occurred, limited to that
Line 21, 16:06:52: scuff mark from the shoe that's in the roadway?
Line 22, 16:06:52: A Yes. There's physical evidence that puts
Line 23, 16:06:52: him at that location.

Line 5, 16:06:52: straight line?
Line 6, 16:06:52: A No evidence.
Line 7, 16:06:52: Q Do you have any evidence of any other

Line 9, 16:06:52: I know you don't have specific recall of
Line 10, 16:06:52: it, but does anything in your investigation, lookin
Line 11, 16:06:52: at Exhibit 1, give you any indication that there wa
Line 12, 16:06:52: more than one pedestrian crossing the roadway?
Line 13, 16:06:52: A No.
Line 14, 16:06:52: Q And that includes even the statement of
Line 15, 16:06:52: the driver, Ms. Barracato; right?
Line 16, 16:06:52: A Yes.
Line 17, 16:06:52: Q Your report concludes, essentially, that
Line 18, 16:06:52: the pedestrian is at fault for this accident.
Line 19, 16:06:52: Why is that?
Line 20, 16:06:52: A There's not a marked crosswalk.
Line 21, 16:06:52: Basically, the pedestrian is illegally in the
Line 22, 16:06:52: roadway. Cars have the right of way.
Line 23, 16:06:52: Q Were you able to determine the color of

Line 17, 16:06:52: Q And one of the findings that you would
