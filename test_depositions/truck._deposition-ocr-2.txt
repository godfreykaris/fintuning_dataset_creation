Line 14, 16:02:10: stuff, the product I load, the gallons and stuff
Line 15, 16:02:10: I put on the trailer.
Line 16, 16:02:10: Q: So this is not your DR.
Line 17, 16:02:10: A: No, that’s nota DR.
Line 18, 16:02:10: Q: Is this more like a purchase order ora
Line 19, 16:02:10: bill of lading?
Line 20, 16:02:10: A: Yes. This is like a — it says, sold
Line 21, 16:02:10: to Mirant. They come out of Center Oil, so in
Line 22, 16:02:10: other words, this is their paperwork where I
Line 23, 16:02:10: load the product out of.
Line 24, 16:02:10: Page
Line 25, 16:02:10: Q: Okay. So the two pieces of paper that
Line 26, 16:02:10: are in front of us, Deposition Exhibit Number 1
Line 27, 16:02:10: and Deposition Exhibit Number 2, are not your DR
Line 28, 16:02:10: paperwork. This is paperwork that was supplied

Line 40, 16:02:10: fuel into your tanker; is that correct?
Line 41, 16:02:10: A: That’s correct.
Line 42, 16:02:10: Q: And on this paperwork, it indicates a
Line 43, 16:02:10: sold to box that says Mirant Corp., George E.
Line 44, 16:02:10: Warren?
Line 45, 16:02:10: A: That’s correct.

Line 14, 16:02:10: always called Center Oil Point, that’s correct.
Line 15, 16:02:10: Q: And so that is the location where you
Line 16, 16:02:10: actually filled your tanker up with fuel; is
Line 17, 16:02:10: that correct?
Line 18, 16:02:10: A: That's correct.
Line 19, 16:02:10: Q: And this is their paperwork, correct?
Line 20, 16:02:10: A: Correct, that’s correct. It wouldn’t
Line 21, 16:02:10: have on — which it doesn’t. It’s got Mirant.
Line 22, 16:02:10: I did go to Mirant, but see they ship different

Line 26, 16:02:10: Maryland. I went to Dickerson, Maryland, which
Line 27, 16:02:10: that would have been on the DR.
Line 28, 16:02:10: Q: And the DR is what we don’t have?
Line 29, 16:02:10: A: That is correct.
Line 30, 16:02:10: Q: So on Deposition Exhibit Number 2, I
Line 31, 16:02:10: just want to come back to this for a second, it
Line 32, 16:02:10: says that on March 13th of 2006 — and this
Line 33, 16:02:10: looks like 4:40?

Line 35, 16:02:10: Q: In the morning, correct?
Line 36, 16:02:10: A: Yes. You know, I'm just trying to give
Line 37, 16:02:10: you a time frame. I might not be perfect on
Line 38, 16:02:10: this. This has been a while back.
Line 39, 16:02:10: Q: Sure. I understand.
Line 40, 16:02:10: A: It’s got to be correct if that’s the
Line 41, 16:02:10: time on it that I loaded it.
Line 42, 16:02:10: Q: And you loaded it — as far as
Line 43, 16:02:10: Deposition Exhibit Number 2, you loaded up your
Line 44, 16:02:10: tanker with fuel at Center Point.
Line 45, 16:02:10: A: That’s correct.

Line 31, 16:02:10: to Mirant Corp. in Maryland, right?
Line 32, 16:02:10: A: That’s correct.
Line 33, 16:02:10: Q: How do you know it was Dickerson?
Line 34, 16:02:10: A: It’s on my DR.

Line 42, 16:02:10: A: It tells you right there where I went
Line 43, 16:02:10: with it.
Line 44, 16:02:10: Q: Okay.
Line 45, 16:02:10: A: If that’s what you're looking for,

Line 47, 16:02:10: Maryland.That’s where I shipped it to.
Line 48, 16:02:10: Q: Okay. So according to this document,
Line 49, 16:02:10: even though it’s not your DR, you went to
Line 50, 16:02:10: Baltimore, you filled up your tanker and you
Line 51, 16:02:10: went to Dickerson, Maryland?
Line 52, 16:02:10: A: That’s correct.

Line 54, 16:02:10: you took from Baltimore to Dickerson?
Line 55, 16:02:10: A: 495 — 95 to 495. 495 runs together

Line 5, 16:02:10: determine what time you arrived in Dickerson?
Line 6, 16:02:10: A: No. It wouldn't anyway, because they
Line 7, 16:02:10: wouldn't -- I’m the one that’s got to mark it on
Line 8, 16:02:10: my log what time I got there. It wouldn't be on
Line 9, 16:02:10: here. They wouldn't know.
Line 10, 16:02:10: Q: And when you got to Dickerson, you
Line 11, 16:02:10: dumped your fuel there, right?
Line 12, 16:02:10: A: That’s correct.

Line 28, 16:02:10: needed for that.
Line 29, 16:02:10: A: That’s correct.
Line 30, 16:02:10: Q: So you didn’t have to go back to Glen
Line 31, 16:02:10: Burnie.
Line 32, 16:02:10: A: That’s correct.

Line 8, 16:02:10: that. All right. So when you went back to
Line 9, 16:02:10: Baltimore to fill up your second tanker on
Line 10, 16:02:10: Deposition Exhibit Number 1, it indicates it was
Line 11, 16:02:10: about 8:47. Does that look about right?
Line 12, 16:02:10: A: That’s correct.
Line 13, 16:02:10: Q: So that would have been the time you
Line 14, 16:02:10: started to begin the fueling?
Line 15, 16:02:10: A: That’s correct.
Line 16, 16:02:10: MS. ZOIS: Okay. Let's go off the
Line 17, 16:02:10: record for one second.
Line 18, 16:02:10: (A discussion was held off the record.)
Line 19, 16:02:10: BY MS. ZOIS:
Line 20, 16:02:10: Q: So according to Deposition Exhibit
Line 21, 16:02:10: Number 1, you arrived back in Baltimore
Line 22, 16:02:10: approximately 8:47 to get your second tank of
Line 23, 16:02:10: fuel, correct?
Line 24, 16:02:10: A: That’s correct.
Line 25, 16:02:10: Q: And you were going to haul your second
Line 26, 16:02:10: Page z
Line 27, 16:02:10: Tank of fuel to Dickerson?
Line 28, 16:02:10: A: That’s correct.
Line 29, 16:02:10: Q: And did you take the same route to
Line 30, 16:02:10: Dickerson from Baltimore that you told me about
Line 31, 16:02:10: before?
Line 32, 16:02:10: A: That’s correct, I always do.
Line 33, 16:02:10: Q: And after you unloaded your second tank
Line 34, 16:02:10: of fuel in Dickerson, were you going to head
Line 35, 16:02:10: home from there?
Line 36, 16:02:10: A: That’s correct.
Line 37, 16:02:10: Q: Do you know what time you left
Line 38, 16:02:10: Dickerson to head home?
Line 39, 16:02:10: A: I'm going to say around 12:00, quarter
Line 40, 16:02:10: to 12:00.
Line 41, 16:02:10: Q: How sure are you about the time?
Line 42, 16:02:10: A: Because the time that it took me to get
Line 43, 16:02:10: up there and the time I unload, that’s the time
Line 44, 16:02:10: I normally leave there when I run two loads to
Line 45, 16:02:10: Dickerson, Between 11:30 and 12:00 is the time
Line 46, 16:02:10: T normally leave Dickerson, Maryland.
Line 47, 16:02:10: Q: And you're basing that on having done
Line 48, 16:02:10: this run before?

Line 15, 16:02:10: genius.
Line 16, 16:02:10: Q: I didn’t think so. I just wanted to
Line 17, 16:02:10: check. But we do know that you left Dickerson
Line 18, 16:02:10: with your second load at 8:47 a.m.
Line 19, 16:02:10: A: I left Baltimore.
Line 20, 16:02:10: Q: I’m sorry, you're right, Baltimore when

Line 33, 16:02:10: comes by itself at the split.

Line 5, 16:02:19: A: I stop at all railroad tracks, so I had

Line 15, 16:02:19: A: Back out to 5 — no, Mattawoman
Line 16, 16:02:19: Beantown Road comes back out to 5.

Line 23, 16:02:19: Page 32
Line 24, 16:02:19: lanes for a while and then it opens up to two
Line 25, 16:02:19: left-hand turn lanes and two lanes, correct?

Line 36, 16:02:19: prefer to take the outside lane, if you will, to
Line 37, 16:02:19: take that left-hand turn; is that right?
Line 38, 16:02:19: A: That’s correct, I always do. We're not
Line 39, 16:02:19: supposed to be in the middle or the lane all the
Line 40, 16:02:19: way OVEL.
Line 41, 16:02:19: Q: So when you take your left from

Line 25, 16:02:19: Baltimore Tank Lines or anyone else who has any
Line 26, 16:02:19: record of when your trips started and ended that

Line 35, 16:02:19: try to keep stuff at least a year in the past,

Line 37, 16:02:19: at something.
Line 38, 16:02:19: Q: Now, let me get back to your usual
Line 39, 16:02:19: routine when you're traveling in the vicinity of
Line 40, 16:02:19: where this incident occurred. I understood you
Line 41, 16:02:19: to say that when you turned from 301 — 5,301
Line 42, 16:02:19: onto Mattawoman Beantown Road, you always get in
Line 43, 16:02:19: the extreme right-hand lane of those three

Line 45, 16:02:19: A: That is correct.
Line 46, 16:02:19: Q: And you go a certain distance and
Line 47, 16:02:19: there’s a railroad track?
Line 48, 16:02:19: A: You've got to stop.
Line 49, 16:02:19: Q: And then after that, that third lane
Line 50, 16:02:19: disappears. You have to move over; is that

Line 17, 16:02:28: (16) thing? |
Line 18, 16:02:28: (17) A: Well, it wouldn’t have been back and
Line 19, 16:02:28: (18) forth. When I go in it, I stay in it, I mean
Line 20, 16:02:28: (19) because that’s it. When the right ends, you've
