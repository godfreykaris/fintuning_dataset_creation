Line 29, 16:06:25: Q: So there’s three left-hand turn lanes
Line 30, 16:06:25: to take the left onto Mattawoman Beantown Road.

Line 33, 16:06:25: stopped at that traffic signal or not?
Line 34, 16:06:25: A: That I can’t remember.
Line 35, 16:06:25: Q: Is there a lane that you favor when
Line 36, 16:06:25: you're in those three left-hand turn lanes?
Line 37, 16:06:25: A: I’ve got to be on the outside lane.
Line 38, 16:06:25: All trucks have got to be on the outside Jane,
Line 39, 16:06:25: because you've got two cars on the inside. You

Line 43, 16:06:25: A: Outside come all the way around.
Line 44, 16:06:25: Q: — you mean the far right-hand lane of

Line 75, 16:06:25: Q: And on your regular route home from
Line 76, 16:06:25: Dickerson, you take a left onto Mattawoman
Line 77, 16:06:25: Beantown Road and then where do you go from
Line 78, 16:06:25: there?
Line 79, 16:06:25: A: Back out to 5 — no, Mattawoman
Line 80, 16:06:25: Beantown Road comes back out to 5.
Line 81, 16:06:25: Q: Then what do you do at the intersection
Line 82, 16:06:25: of Mattawoman Beantown Road and Route 5?
Line 83, 16:06:25: A: Are you talking at the end of it?
Line 84, 16:06:25: Q: Yes, sir.
Line 85, 16:06:25: A: I make a left. I head south.
Line 86, 16:06:25: Q: And Mattawoman Beantown Road has two
Line 87, 16:06:25: Page 32
Line 88, 16:06:25: lanes for a while and then it opens up to two
Line 89, 16:06:25: left-hand turn lanes and two lanes, correct?
Line 90, 16:06:25: A: At the end of it.
Line 91, 16:06:25: Q: Right.
Line 92, 16:06:25: A: There’s two that goes over and two
Line 93, 16:06:25: stays to the right that goes into St. Charles
Line 94, 16:06:25: and there’s two turn lanes that go south towards
Line 95, 16:06:25: Leonardtown Road.
Line 96, 16:06:25: Q: And that’s the direction you would have
Line 97, 16:06:25: been heading?
Line 98, 16:06:25: A: That’s correct.
Line 99, 16:06:25: Q: And you've already told us that you
Line 100, 16:06:25: prefer to take the outside lane, if you will, to
Line 101, 16:06:25: take that left-hand turn; is that right?
Line 102, 16:06:25: A: That’s correct, I always do. We're not
Line 103, 16:06:25: supposed to be in the middle or the lane all the
Line 104, 16:06:25: way over.
Line 105, 16:06:25: Q: So when you take your left from
Line 106, 16:06:25: Mattawoman Beantown Road onto southbound Route
Line 107, 16:06:25: 5, you would be in the right-hand of the two

Line 4, 16:06:25: talking about getting off at the end of
Line 5, 16:06:25: Mattawoman Beantown Road, there’s only two
Line 6, 16:06:25: turning lanes there.
Line 7, 16:06:25: Q: Okay. So you would have one lane of
Line 8, 16:06:25: traffic to your left at that intersection.
Line 9, 16:06:25: A: One lane, that’s correct.
Line 10, 16:06:25: Q: And just so — I know I’ve asked this
Line 11, 16:06:25: before, but do you have any specific
Line 12, 16:06:25: recollection of any traffic in the area of

Line 19, 16:06:25: take it out. It’s in my file.
Line 20, 16:06:25: Q: And your logbook would tell us what
Line 21, 16:06:25: your pickup and drop-off was back on the date of
Line 22, 16:06:25: this accident?
Line 23, 16:06:25: A: That is correct.

Line 42, 16:06:25: like that, is that logged on your logbook?
Line 43, 16:06:25: A: No. Not five, ten minutes, no.
Line 44, 16:06:25: Q: What about like a half an hour?
Line 45, 16:06:25: A: Yeah, a half hour.A half hour would

Line 62, 16:06:25: A: Right, but it should be in there. I
Line 63, 16:06:25: don't see no reason why it wouldn’t.
Line 64, 16:06:25: Q: Other than your logbook, do you know of
Line 65, 16:06:25: any other record by you or the people at

Line 80, 16:06:25: routine when you're traveling in the vicinity of
Line 81, 16:06:25: where this incident occurred. I understood you
Line 82, 16:06:25: to say that when you turned from 301 — 5,301
Line 83, 16:06:25: onto Mattawoman Beantown Road, you always get in
Line 84, 16:06:25: the extreme right-hand lane of those three

Line 86, 16:06:25: A: That is correct.

Line 89, 16:06:25: A: You've got to stop.
Line 90, 16:06:25: Q: And then after that, that third lane
Line 91, 16:06:25: disappears. You have to move over; is that
Line 92, 16:06:25: correct?

Line 5, 16:06:34: 3} A: That’s correct.
Line 6, 16:06:34: 4) Q: And from that point where you merged
Line 7, 16:06:34: 5} into the right-hand lane of the two through
Line 8, 16:06:34: 6) lanes, you’ve passed the railroad track now.
Line 9, 16:06:34: A: That’s correct.
Line 10, 16:06:34: 8) Q: Did you stay in that right-hand lane
Line 11, 16:06:34: 9] all the way down to where the two-lane portion
Line 12, 16:06:34: [10] Of Mattawoman Beantown Road ended?

Line 15, 16:06:34: 13] =A: I don’t know.
Line 16, 16:06:34: (14) Q: So it’s possible you could have gone
Line 17, 16:06:34: (15) into the left lane, back again and that kind of
Line 18, 16:06:34: (16) thing?
Line 19, 16:06:34: (177 A: Well, it wouldn’t have been back and
Line 20, 16:06:34: (18) forth. When I go in it, I stay in it, I mean
Line 21, 16:06:34: (19) because that’s it. When the right ends, you've
Line 22, 16:06:34: [20] got to be over to the left lane.
Line 23, 16:06:34: (24 Q: But that’s some distance from —
Line 24, 16:06:34: 22] A: It’s a quarter of a mile.

Line 29, 16:06:34: 4) A: Right.
Line 30, 16:06:34: Q: And it continues for two lanes for
Line 31, 16:06:34: 6) several miles until you get down to Route 5.
Line 32, 16:06:34: A: Right.
Line 33, 16:06:34: 8} Q: I’m talking about that area. Did you
Line 34, 16:06:34: 9] stay in that right-hand lane once you got in it
Line 35, 16:06:34: or did you move?
Line 36, 16:06:34: A: I can’t — I don't know if I did or
Line 37, 16:06:34: not.
Line 38, 16:06:34: Q: As you approached the area where the
Line 39, 16:06:34: four lanes begin just before you get to Route 5,
Line 40, 16:06:34: are you with me?
Line 41, 16:06:34: A: Yeah.

Line 62, 16:06:34: Q: Is that the traffic light you're
Line 63, 16:06:34: talking about?
Line 64, 16:06:34: A: After I usually go through that light,
Line 65, 16:06:34: I merge over to my left Jane if I’m in the right
Line 66, 16:06:34: lane.
Line 67, 16:06:34: Q: Okay.
Line 68, 16:06:34: A: Sometimes I'm already in the other
Line 69, 16:06:34: lane. But if I'm in the right, I’ve got to
Line 70, 16:06:34: merge Over to get up to the turning point. I
Line 71, 16:06:34: never wait until I get to the turning point to
Line 72, 16:06:34: try to get over.
Line 73, 16:06:34: Q: Okay. And then assuming that’s your
Line 74, 16:06:34: routine, you get over into the left lane, as you
Line 75, 16:06:34: then get to the area of the road whete it
Line 76, 16:06:34: becomes four lanes, what is your routine?

Line 81, 16:06:34: lanes.
Line 82, 16:06:34: A: Well, it actually merges into it. When
Line 83, 16:06:34: you merge over, there will be traffic. You
Line 84, 16:06:34: either could go over all the way to the right or
Line 85, 16:06:34: stay in the left at that light.
Line 86, 16:06:34: Q: All right.
Line 87, 16:06:34: A: Which I always stay in the right,
Line 88, 16:06:34: because I can’t get all the way over because of
Line 89, 16:06:34: the turn. You've got to have the ratio to turn,
Line 90, 16:06:34: the turning ratio.
Line 91, 16:06:34: Q: But at some point, and it’s your
Line 92, 16:06:34: routine to get into that right most turn lane —

Line 94, 16:06:34: A: Right.
Line 95, 16:06:34: Q: Two lanes, one — they're both going
