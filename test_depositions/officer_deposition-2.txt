Line 3, 16:04:42: A If we -- if the crash came up, the police
Line 4, 16:04:42: responded, and patrol units would request the crash
Line 5, 16:04:42: team and we responded, we would go to the scene an
Line 6, 16:04:42: I guess, get out and talk to witnesses, analyze the
Line 7, 16:04:42: scene, take measurements and photographs, and
Line 8, 16:04:42: respond to the hospital. I guess that's normal
Line 9, 16:04:42: protocol.
Line 10, 16:04:42: Q When you arrived, were you alone?
Line 11, 16:04:42: A I don't recall.
Line 12, 16:04:42: Q What would have been the practice; would
Line 13, 16:04:42: you have been alone or would you have had someone
Line 14, 16:04:42: with you?
Line 15, 16:04:42: A Usually, it's one officer per car, and we
Line 16, 16:04:42: work the entire county so it's not -- other people
Line 17, 16:04:42: could have been other places in the county and they
Line 18, 16:04:42: all go to the crash so we respond at different
Line 19, 16:04:42: times. So I don't recall.
Line 20, 16:04:42: Q What equipment did you have with you; did
Line 21, 16:04:42: you have a digital camera?
Line 22, 16:04:42: A For the unit, yes, because we use a
Line 23, 16:04:42: digital camera for pictures, but each car has
Line 24, 16:04:42: different equipment in it. I mean, usually it's
--- End of Page 5 ---

Line 1, 16:04:42: 16
Line 2, 16:04:42: measuring equipment, like a wheelie-walker, tape 1 would one of your subordinates speak with the
Line 3, 16:04:42: measures, levels, that kind of thing. But, as in 2 witnesses?
Line 4, 16:04:42: who brought the camera that was used, I don't 3 A When we arrive at a scene, we all take
Line 5, 16:04:42: recall. 4 different jobs just to facilitate, I guess, handling
Line 6, 16:04:42: Q Did you take the pictures? 5 the crash quicker to open up the roadway. So
Line 7, 16:04:42: A I don't recall if I did or not. 6 somebody does pictures, somebody does measurements,
Line 8, 16:04:42: Q The pictures that are marked as Exhibit 2 7 somebody talks to witnesses, somebody talks to the
Line 9, 16:04:42: and they are subtitled A through M, do you recognize 8 drivers. So the jobs get shuffled up every time we
Line 10, 16:04:42: those as pictures from this file? 9 go.
Line 11, 16:04:42: A Yes. The only the thing I'd say is that's 10 Q So you can't say who would have done --
Line 12, 16:04:42: my arm -- 11 A Yeah.
Line 13, 16:04:42: Q Okay. 12 Q -- that task on September 19, 2013?
Line 14, 16:04:42: A -- on J. 13 A No.
Line 15, 16:04:42: Q On Exhibit 2J, you recognize your arm, and 14 Q There is a statement from the driver which
Line 16, 16:04:42: it's the exhibit of the hand holding the shoe? 15 is part of Exhibit 1, the second to last page, and
Line 17, 16:04:42: A Yes. So, by that, I would surmise that I 16 then also from a witness named Grant Baber. You're

Line 3, 16:04:42: individual?
Line 4, 16:04:42: Q Yes.
Line 5, 16:04:42: A No, it doesn't. I would say, like, our
Line 6, 16:04:42: normal protocol is I don't take the statement, but
Line 7, 16:04:42: my name is on the long form because that's -- they
Line 8, 16:04:42: all have to filled out. Since it's my report, I get
Line 9, 16:04:42: all the statements and I just put my name on them
Line 10, 16:04:42: Q Understood.
Line 11, 16:04:42: A -- before we turn in the report.
Line 12, 16:04:42: Q Okay. That's why I was asking.
Line 13, 16:04:42: So I know you don't have any independent

Line 18, 16:04:42: A Um --
Line 19, 16:04:42: Q Just in summary form. You don't have to
Line 20, 16:04:42: go into great detail.
Line 21, 16:04:42: A I respond to the scene, and I get out.
Line 22, 16:04:42: Usually I walk the scene to get an idea of what
Line 23, 16:04:42: happened, if there's any evidence on the road,
Line 24, 16:04:42: damage to the car, see if there are witnesses.

Line 1, 16:04:42: 20
Line 2, 16:04:42: Then it's take notes of the car, note any 1 the scene is left alone. So cars are not supposed
Line 3, 16:04:42: vehicle damage, take photographs of the car, 2 to be moved before our arrival; and, if they are, we
Line 4, 16:04:42: photograph the scene, make note of any evidence in 3 are noted, like we are given notation.
Line 5, 16:04:42: the roadway of either shoe scuffs, hats, shoes, 4 Q And you don't have any notation that this
Line 6, 16:04:42: blood. 5 vehicle was moved before you arrived on the scene?
Line 7, 16:04:42: Then measure the scene, measure the 6 A Correct.
Line 8, 16:04:42: evidence that we found, and talk to the witnesses 7 Q There were cones set up as shown in
Line 9, 16:04:42: and drivers, if they are available and at the scene. 8 photograph 2A.
Line 10, 16:04:42: Then, once the on-scene investigation is complete, 9 Would those be cones you would have placed
Line 11, 16:04:42: then usually it's respond to the hospital and speak 10 just from your practice or would they have been put
Line 12, 16:04:42: to the individuals involved. 11 there before you arrived?
Line 13, 16:04:42: Q And you don't have any recollection of 12 A I would say it's standard practice for a
Line 14, 16:04:42: going to the hospital and speaking with 13 patrol to cone items, especially in pedestrian
Line 15, 16:04:42: ? 14 crashes, that are of interest, shoes, hats, and

Line 17, 16:04:42: Q Exhibit 2 is the photographs taken at the 16 and it's moved, they still have the general area of
Line 18, 16:04:42: scene, we believe. The third picture, photo C 17 where it was.
Line 19, 16:04:42: labeled down in the corner, shows -- it looks like 18 So we usually do not put down cones. I

Line 3, 16:04:42: heading, quote, Part 2: Observations (of the
Line 4, 16:04:42: investigator).
Line 5, 16:04:42: Are you the investigator referred to
Line 6, 16:04:42: there?
Line 7, 16:04:42: A Yes.
Line 8, 16:04:42: Q So those were your observations in the
Line 9, 16:04:42: narration underneath part 2?
Line 10, 16:04:42: A Yes.
Line 11, 16:04:42: Q Let's go down to the one thing that you do
Line 12, 16:04:42: specifically recall because it was unusual and that
Line 13, 16:04:42: is the dirt mark in the road.
Line 14, 16:04:42: Was it dirt or was it, in fact, dog feces
Line 15, 16:04:42: or a combination of both?
Line 16, 16:04:42: A I think it was a combination of both
Line 17, 16:04:42: because it was unusual. Shoe scuffs are very har
Line 18, 16:04:42: to find and to have one on scene is kind of -- it's
Line 19, 16:04:42: a rarity. The dirt on the shoe makes the shoe
Line 20, 16:04:42: scuff. Like I said, that's the only thing I
Line 21, 16:04:42: remember from the crash.
Line 22, 16:04:42: Q Fair enough. How did you determine that
Line 23, 16:04:42: the -- strike that.
Line 24, 16:04:42: There's a photo in Exhibit 2, subphoto D,
--- End of Page 9 ---

Line 1, 16:04:42: 24
Line 2, 16:04:42: the fourth one down. 1 points for the following measurements.
Line 3, 16:04:42: Is that a photo of the transfer of the 2 Q Okay. And then you measured the road
Line 4, 16:04:42: dirt or dog feces to the roadway that you're talking 3 dimensions of Wilkens Avenue?
Line 5, 16:04:42: about remembering? 4 A Yes.
Line 6, 16:04:42: A Yes. 5 Q And that's not using the reference points.
Line 7, 16:04:42: Q And it's your opinion that shows what? 6 That's just measuring the roadway; correct?
Line 8, 16:04:42: A It shows where the shoe was located when 7 A Yes.
Line 9, 16:04:42: it was, I guess, abruptly moved sideways. That 8 Q Then, beneath that, you have measurements
Line 10, 16:04:42: would be considered the AOI, area of impact. 9 of the wheel position of all four wheels of the

Line 19, 16:04:42: A No.
Line 20, 16:04:42: Q Why not?
