Line 14, 16:04:18: A: That’s correct.
Line 15, 16:04:18: Q: And it will further record the time
Line 16, 16:04:18: that you arrived back in Center Point in
Line 17, 16:04:18: Baltimore?
Line 18, 16:04:18: A: That's correct,
Line 19, 16:04:18: Q: And then for your second trip, your
Line 20, 16:04:18: logbook will also show when you left Center
Line 21, 16:04:18: Point to go back to Dickerson?
Line 22, 16:04:18: A: That’s correct.

Line 3, 16:04:18: 8:47, a quarter of 9:00 roughly?
Line 4, 16:04:18: A: That’s correct.
Line 5, 16:04:18: Q: So you would have left quarter of 9:00,
Line 6, 16:04:18: maybe 9 o'clock to go back to Dickerson.
Line 7, 16:04:18: A: That's correct.
Line 8, 16:04:18: Q: Now you're in the rush-hour traffic.
Line 9, 16:04:18: It’s going to take you a little bit longer.
Line 10, 16:04:18: A: That’s correct.
Line 11, 16:04:18: Q: And you made this run a number of times
Line 12, 16:04:18: in rush hour?
Line 13, 16:04:18: A: Yes, I have.
Line 14, 16:04:18: Q: What would you ball park as the time it
Line 15, 16:04:18: would take you during rush hour, morning rush
Line 16, 16:04:18: hour to go from Baltimore to Dickerson?
Line 17, 16:04:18: A: It usually takes me an extra sometimes
Line 18, 16:04:18: minutes to a half hour, so it will put me at
Line 19, 16:04:18: Dickerson at 11 o’clock.
Line 20, 16:04:18: Q: And then you unload and that’s a
Line 21, 16:04:18: 20-minute to a half-hour process?
Line 22, 16:04:18: A: That is correct.

Line 12, 16:04:18: A: Well, I’m going to look in my file. I
Line 13, 16:04:18: should be able to find it. It’s in my file.
Line 14, 16:04:18: Q: Are you required to keep those logs for
Line 15, 16:04:18: a certain period of time?
Line 16, 16:04:18: A: Six months.
Line 17, 16:04:18: Q: So you may or may not have it.
Line 18, 16:04:18: A: Right, but it should be in there. I
Line 19, 16:04:18: don't see no reason why it wouldn’t.
Line 20, 16:04:18: Q: Other than your logbook, do you know of
Line 21, 16:04:18: any other record by you or the people at
Line 22, 16:04:18: Baltimore Tank Lines or anyone else who has any
Line 23, 16:04:18: record of when your trips started and ended that

Line 14, 16:04:18: routine when you're traveling in the vicinity of
Line 15, 16:04:18: where this incident occurred. I understood you
Line 16, 16:04:18: to say that when you turned from 301 — 5,301
Line 17, 16:04:18: onto Mattawoman Beantown Road, you always get in
Line 18, 16:04:18: the extreme right-hand lane of those three
Line 19, 16:04:18: turning lanes; is that correct?
Line 20, 16:04:18: A: That is correct.
Line 21, 16:04:18: Q: And you go a certain distance and
Line 22, 16:04:18: there’s a railroad track?
Line 23, 16:04:18: A: You've got to stop.
Line 24, 16:04:18: Q: And then after that, that third lane
Line 25, 16:04:18: disappears. You have to move over; is that
Line 26, 16:04:18: correct?
Line 27, 16:04:18: A: You've got to merge into the left into

Line 3, 16:04:26: Q: And you did that?
Line 4, 16:04:26: A: That's correct.
Line 5, 16:04:26: Q: And from that point where you merged
Line 6, 16:04:26: into the right-hand lane of the two through
Line 7, 16:04:26: lanes, you’ve passed the railroad track now.
Line 8, 16:04:26: A: That’s correct.
Line 9, 16:04:26: Q: Did you stay in that right-hand Jane
Line 10, 16:04:26: all the way down to where the two-lane portion
Line 11, 16:04:26: of Mattawoman Beantown Road ended?
Line 12, 16:04:26: A: I can’t —
Line 13, 16:04:26: Q: You don’t know?
Line 14, 16:04:26: A: I don't know.
Line 15, 16:04:26: Q: So it’s possible you could have gone
Line 16, 16:04:26: into the left lane, back again and that kind of
Line 17, 16:04:26: thing?
Line 18, 16:04:26: A: Well, it wouldn’t have been back and
Line 19, 16:04:26: forth. When I go in it, I Stay in it, I mean
Line 20, 16:04:26: because that’s it. When the right ends, you've
Line 21, 16:04:26: got to be over to the left lane.
Line 22, 16:04:26: Q: But that’s some distance from —

Line 9, 16:04:26: Q: I'm talking about that area. Did you
Line 10, 16:04:26: stay in that right-hand lane once you got in it
Line 11, 16:04:26: or did you move?
Line 12, 16:04:26: A: I can’t — I don’t know if I did or
Line 13, 16:04:26: not.
Line 14, 16:04:26: Q: As you approached the area where the
Line 15, 16:04:26: four lanes begin just before you get to Route 5,

Line 14, 16:04:26: A: Sometimes I'm already in the other
