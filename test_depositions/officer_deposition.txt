Line 10, 16:01:50: respond to the hospital. I guess that's normal 6 Q Looking at your report that's labeled as
Line 11, 16:01:50: protocol. 7 Exhibit 1, does that assist you in determining
Line 12, 16:01:50: Q When you arrived, were you alone? 8 whether you had any interaction with either the
Line 13, 16:01:50: A I don't recall. 9 pedestrian or the vehicle driver

Line 15, 16:01:50: you have been alone or would you have had someone 11 A Does it assist me in recalling if I spoke
Line 16, 16:01:50: with you? 12 to them?
Line 17, 16:01:50: A Usually, it's one officer per car, and we 13 Q Yes. In other words, if you look at that,
Line 18, 16:01:50: work the entire county so it's not -- other people 14 does that refresh you; would you say, oh, yeah, I
Line 19, 16:01:50: could have been other places in the county and they 15 spoke with the lady or I spoke with the man?
Line 20, 16:01:50: all go to the crash so we respond at different 16 A If I wrote in the report that I spoke to
Line 21, 16:01:50: times. So I don't recall. 17 the individual, then I spoke to them. In this

Line 23, 16:01:50: you have a digital camera? 19 and I just copied their written statements. So, by
Line 24, 16:01:50: A For the unit, yes, because we use a 20 that, I would say, no, I did not talk to them.
Line 25, 16:01:50: digital camera for pictures, but each car has 21 Q What would have been the practice back
Line 26, 16:01:50: different equipment in it. I mean, usually it's 22 then; normally, would you speak with witnesses or
Line 27, 16:01:50: 16
Line 28, 16:01:50: measuring equipment, like a wheelie-walker, tape 1 would one of your subordinates speak with the
Line 29, 16:01:50: measures, levels, that kind of thing. But, as in 2 witnesses?
Line 30, 16:01:50: who brought the camera that was used, I don't 3 A When we arrive at a scene, we all take
Line 31, 16:01:50: recall. 4 different jobs just to facilitate, I guess, handling
Line 32, 16:01:50: Q Did you take the pictures? 5 the crash quicker to open up the roadway. So
Line 33, 16:01:50: A I don't recall if I did or not. 6 somebody does pictures, somebody does measurements,

Line 36, 16:01:50: those as pictures from this file? 9 go.
Line 37, 16:01:50: A Yes. The only the thing I'd say is that's 10 Q So you can't say who would have done --
Line 38, 16:01:50: my arm -- 11 A Yeah.
Line 39, 16:01:50: Q Okay. 12 Q -- that task on September 19, 2013?

Line 8, 16:01:50: normal protocol is I don't take the statement, but 4 is doing in that photograph?
Line 9, 16:01:50: my name is on the long form because that's -- they 5 A Probably either making note of what's

Line 11, 16:01:50: all the statements and I just put my name on them -- 7 to do an image of the air bag monitor.
Line 12, 16:01:50: Q Understood. 8 Q Do you know if any EDR data was downloaded
Line 13, 16:01:50: A -- before we turn in the report. 9 for this crash in that vehicle?
Line 14, 16:01:50: Q Okay. That's why I was asking. 10 A The only thing I can say is if it's not in
Line 15, 16:01:50: So I know you don't have any independent 11 the report -- I mean, if it's in the report, it was
Line 16, 16:01:50: recollection of this specific accident, but take me 12 done. If it's not in the report, it didn't get
Line 17, 16:01:50: through the steps that you would go through when 13 done. Because sometimes you can download a car and,
Line 18, 16:01:50: investigating an accident of this nature back at 14 if it's not severe enough, it doesn't record
Line 19, 16:01:50: that time. 15 anything.

Line 21, 16:01:50: Q Just in summary form. You don't have to 17 recollection -- independent recollection because of
Line 22, 16:01:50: go into great detail. 18 the number of crashes you investigate, but when you
Line 23, 16:01:50: A I respond to the scene, and I get out. 19 arrived do you recall if the motor vehicle was in
Line 24, 16:01:50: Usually I walk the scene to get an idea of what 20 the general vicinity that is shown on photograph 2A?
Line 25, 16:01:50: happened, if there's any evidence on the road, 21 A The only the thing I can testify to is
Line 26, 16:01:50: damage to the car, see if there are witnesses. 22 that it is, I guess, protocol that if we're called
Line 27, 16:01:50: 20
Line 28, 16:01:50: Then it's take notes of the car, note any 1 the scene is left alone. So cars are not supposed
Line 29, 16:01:50: vehicle damage, take photographs of the car, 2 to be moved before our arrival; and, if they are, we
Line 30, 16:01:50: photograph the scene, make note of any evidence in 3 are noted, like we are given notation.
Line 31, 16:01:50: the roadway of either shoe scuffs, hats, shoes, 4 Q And you don't have any notation that this
Line 32, 16:01:50: blood. 5 vehicle was moved before you arrived on the scene?
Line 33, 16:01:50: Then measure the scene, measure the 6 A Correct.
Line 34, 16:01:50: evidence that we found, and talk to the witnesses 7 Q There were cones set up as shown in

Line 36, 16:01:50: Then, once the on-scene investigation is complete, 9 Would those be cones you would have placed

Line 38, 16:01:50: to the individuals involved. 11 there before you arrived?
Line 39, 16:01:50: Q And you don't have any recollection of 12 A I would say it's standard practice for a

Line 7, 16:01:50: Are you the investigator referred to 3 reconstruction, when you have a shoe scuff, that's
Line 8, 16:01:50: there? 4 the area of impact. It's where the pedestrian was
Line 9, 16:01:50: A Yes. 5 standing when he was struck by the vehicle.
Line 10, 16:01:50: Q So those were your observations in the 6 Q Did you measure where that scuff mark is
Line 11, 16:01:50: narration underneath part 2? 7 in reference to any point?
Line 12, 16:01:50: A Yes. 8 A Yes.
Line 13, 16:01:50: Q Let's go down to the one thing that you do 9 Q What page of the report are you looking
Line 14, 16:01:50: specifically recall because it was unusual and that 10 at?
Line 15, 16:01:50: is the dirt mark in the road. 11 A Page 5.
Line 16, 16:01:50: Was it dirt or was it, in fact, dog feces 12 Q On page 5, in the middle of the page, it
Line 17, 16:01:50: or a combination of both? 13 says, quote, area of impact, dash, 29 feet, 11
Line 18, 16:01:50: A I think it was a combination of both 14 inches east and 8 feet, 11 inches north of the
Line 19, 16:01:50: because it was unusual. Shoe scuffs are very hard 15 reference point; is that what you're looking at?
Line 20, 16:01:50: to find and to have one on scene is kind of -- it's 16 A Yes.
Line 21, 16:01:50: a rarity. The dirt on the shoe makes the shoe 17 Q Up above that writing on page 5 of Exhibit
Line 22, 16:01:50: scuff. Like I said, that's the only thing I 18 1 is your description of what you used as the
Line 23, 16:01:50: remember from the crash. 19 reference points.
Line 24, 16:01:50: Q Fair enough. How did you determine that 20 Can you read that part into the record?
Line 25, 16:01:50: the -- strike that. 21 A The east curb of Beechfield Avenue and the
Line 26, 16:01:50: There's a photo in Exhibit 2, subphoto D, 22 south curb of Wilkens Avenue were used as reference

Line 28, 16:01:50: the fourth one down. 1 points for the following measurements.
Line 29, 16:01:50: Is that a photo of the transfer of the 2 Q Okay. And then you measured the road
Line 30, 16:01:50: dirt or dog feces to the roadway that you're talking 3 dimensions of Wilkens Avenue?
Line 31, 16:01:50: about remembering? 4 A Yes.
Line 32, 16:01:50: A Yes. 5 Q And that's not using the reference points.
Line 33, 16:01:50: Q And it's your opinion that shows what? 6 That's just measuring the roadway; correct?
Line 34, 16:01:50: A It shows where the shoe was located when 7 A Yes.
Line 35, 16:01:50: it was, I guess, abruptly moved sideways. That 8 Q Then, beneath that, you have measurements
Line 36, 16:01:50: would be considered the AOI, area of impact. 9 of the wheel position of all four wheels of the
Line 37, 16:01:50: Q Going on down, photo J is the shoe, and 10 vehicle.
Line 38, 16:01:50: we've already commented you remember that's you hold 11 Are those measurements taken with regard
Line 39, 16:01:50: the shoe there? 12 to the reference points?
Line 40, 16:01:50: A Uh-huh. 13 A Yes.
Line 41, 16:01:50: Q Did you take that photograph or would 14 Q Can you show me maybe using page 9 of the
Line 42, 16:01:50: someone else have taken it? 15 report, the page with the diagram -- is it possible
Line 43, 16:01:50: A I would have taken it. 16 to show me or show us, because we have some
Line 44, 16:01:50: Q Okay. In determining that the transfer of 17 confusion, where those reference points are, if we
Line 45, 16:01:50: the soil to the roadway was the point of impact, did 18 come around and take a look?
Line 46, 16:01:50: you use any calculations or was it just your 19 A Okay.
Line 47, 16:01:50: reckoning from what you saw? 20 Q And the reason I'm asking is because I had
Line 48, 16:01:50: In other words, did you use any analysis 21 a little trouble getting it.
Line 49, 16:01:50: to arrive at that or was it just from a visual 22 A If you look on --

Line 9, 16:01:50: MR. FIORE: Okay. Let's do this, then. 5 A It's 37 feet, 9 inches from this curb.
Line 10, 16:01:50: Let's mark this as the next exhibit. 6 Q From the east curb of Beechfield?
Line 11, 16:01:50: (Exhibit 3 was marked for identification 7 A Yes.
Line 12, 16:01:50: and was retained by counsel.) 8 Q Okay. Was there anything else that
Line 13, 16:01:50: Q We're talking about the reference points 9 factored into your determination of the AOI other
Line 14, 16:01:50: that you used in Exhibit 1 to take some 10 than, essentially, the dead reckoning of seeing the

Line 16, 16:01:50: Exhibit 3. 12 A The one thing I would say is that it
Line 17, 16:01:50: Can you identify what that is? 13 coincides with the damage on the vehicle. It kind
Line 18, 16:01:50: A A copy of my diagram, handwritten diagram. 14 of lined up in the middle of the vehicle. The
Line 19, 16:01:50: Q And would this diagram have been created 15 damage lined up in the middle of the vehicle so it
Line 20, 16:01:50: at the scene or at some point later? 16 all -- I would say they coincided with each other.
Line 21, 16:01:50: A At the scene. 17 Q The area of the resting place for the
Line 22, 16:01:50: Q Can you show us on Exhibit 3 the reference 18 pedestrian, did any calculations go into that other
Line 23, 16:01:50: points you're using when you say you're using the 19 than the fact that that's where the blood was, the
Line 24, 16:01:50: east curb of Beechfield Avenue and the south curb of 20 pool of blood, which I think is shown in one of the
Line 25, 16:01:50: Wilkens Avenue as reference points? 21 photographs?
Line 26, 16:01:50: A The east curb of Beechfield and the south 22 Did anything else go into your calculation
Line 27, 16:01:50: 28
Line 28, 16:01:50: curb of Wilkens. 1 of the final resting point of the pedestrian other
Line 29, 16:01:50: Q Okay. And then you have drawn in a 2 than the pool of blood?
Line 30, 16:01:50: rectangle which depicts the approximate place of the 3 A Calculation or measurement?
Line 31, 16:01:50: vehicle? 4 Because the resting point was not
Line 32, 16:01:50: A Yes. 5 calculated, but measured.
Line 33, 16:01:50: Q And you have drawn in a stick figure that 6 Q And it was measured from the reference
Line 34, 16:01:50: depicts the approximate place of the resting point 7 point to the pool of blood?
Line 35, 16:01:50: for the pedestrian? 8 A Yes.
Line 36, 16:01:50: A Yes. 9 Q I understand.
Line 37, 16:01:50: Q And you have drawn in a dark line along 10 Did you have any idea of the speed of the
Line 38, 16:01:50: the curbing. 11 vehicle just from what you saw there?
Line 39, 16:01:50: Does that indicate the sewer grate? 12 A From my experience, it looked like a
Line 40, 16:01:50: A No. That's just a reference for myself to 13 low-speed impact.
Line 41, 16:01:50: know what curbs I used as reference points. 14 Q And were you basing that on the damage to
Line 42, 16:01:50: Q Okay. So the two dark lines along the 15 the motor vehicle?
Line 43, 16:01:50: curbing are just indications of that's the reference 16 A It's the damage to the motor vehicle and
Line 44, 16:01:50: point -- those are the reference points? 17 the distance from where the pedestrian was struck to
Line 45, 16:01:50: A Yes. 18 where they came to final rest. The higher the

Line 47, 16:01:50: front wheel was 37 feet, 9 inches east and 9 feet -- 20 Q And I would presume the more damage to the

Line 6, 16:01:51: You hadn't done the calculations to come 2 A If I recall, there were some on the west
Line 7, 16:01:51: up with the approximate speed the vehicle was going 3 part of the intersection. There was a crosswalk to
Line 8, 16:01:51: at the scene. Just eyeballing it, your conclusion 4 cross Wilkens Avenue.
Line 9, 16:01:51: was, well, this wasn't a high-speed impact? 5 Q Is there such a thing in Maryland law as
Line 10, 16:01:51: A Correct. 6 an unmarked crosswalk?
Line 11, 16:01:51: Q And you don't recall the driver of the 7 A There is. I think it's called an implied
Line 12, 16:01:51: vehicle saying anything to you as far as what her 8 crosswalk.
Line 13, 16:01:51: speed was? 9 Q And what's an implied crosswalk?
Line 14, 16:01:51: A No. 10 A I don't have the definition.
Line 15, 16:01:51: Q There is a statement by the witness, Grant 11 Q What's the general understanding?
Line 16, 16:01:51: Baber, on the last page of Exhibit 1 where he states 12 I'm not holding you to the words of any
Line 17, 16:01:51: or writes that the vehicle, the black SUV, was 13 statute, but what is your understanding of the
Line 18, 16:01:51: "traveling at a high rate of speed." 14 implied crosswalk?
Line 19, 16:01:51: Did you attach any significance to that 15 A Where you have -- the sidewalk comes down
Line 20, 16:01:51: statement? 16 and the curb is lowered for ease of, I guess,
Line 21, 16:01:51: A No. 17 getting off the curb to go onto the street. When
Line 22, 16:01:51: Q Why not? 18 you have that but no crosswalk, like no painted
Line 23, 16:01:51: A Most witnesses have a false perception of 19 crosswalk, that would be implied.
Line 24, 16:01:51: speed. 20 Q So a pedestrian crossing there would be
Line 25, 16:01:51: Q Do you remember speaking with Mr. Baber? 21 entitled to the protections of a crosswalk even
Line 26, 16:01:51: A No. 22 though there's none painted on the roadway?
Line 27, 16:01:51: 32
Line 28, 16:01:51: Q Mr. Baber also writes "he -- meaning the 1 A I would -- I don't know.
Line 29, 16:01:51: pedestrian -- was in the crosswalk at the time." 2 Q How wide is your standard crosswalk when
Line 30, 16:01:51: Did you attach any significance to that 3 one is painted on the roadway?
Line 31, 16:01:51: statement? 4 A I don't know the specific dimensions, but
Line 32, 16:01:51: A No. 5 usually I would say eight to ten feet.
Line 33, 16:01:51: Q Why not? 6 Q And you're approximating?
Line 34, 16:01:51: A Well, the area of the impact put the -- I 7 A It's an approximation.
Line 35, 16:01:51: mean, the shoe scuff put the area of impact outside 8 Q In your experience, are they usually
Line 36, 16:01:51: of a crosswalk. So pedestrians have -- not 9 uniform sizes when they're painted or do they vary
Line 37, 16:01:51: pedestrians, excuse me, witnesses don't have the 10 in what you've seen?
Line 38, 16:01:51: best recollections. 11 A They vary.
Line 39, 16:01:51: Q Was there a crosswalk at the intersection 12 Q Do you know where Mr. entered
Line 40, 16:01:51: there where the accident occurred, where this 13 the roadway of Wilkens Avenue?
Line 41, 16:01:51: pedestrian was crossing? 14 A As in?
Line 42, 16:01:51: A For Wilkens Avenue where the crash 15 Q Can you identify within a few feet where
Line 43, 16:01:51: occurred there was no crosswalk. 16 he entered the roadway?
Line 44, 16:01:51: Q Are you saying there were no painted 17 A No.
Line 45, 16:01:51: crosswalk lines on the roadway? 18 Q Is your understanding of where he was, at
Line 46, 16:01:51: A No. 19 least when the contact occurred, limited to that
Line 47, 16:01:51: Q That's correct, there were no painted 20 scuff mark from the shoe that's in the roadway?
Line 48, 16:01:51: crosswalk lines on the roadway? 21 A Yes. There's physical evidence that puts
