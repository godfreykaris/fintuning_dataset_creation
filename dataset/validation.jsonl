{"deposition": "It wasn't any direct confrontation or statement, but more of a subtle feeling arising from observing the lack of female representation in leadership roles combined with certain comments about needing to \"work harder\" or \"prove myself\" despite my consistent positive performance reviews. Thank you, Mr. Anderson. These are valuable insights. Do you have any further questions, Ms. Garcia? (after reviewing her notes) I have a few follow-up questions for clarification. However, due to the time constraints, I would like to schedule a follow-up session at your earliest convenience, Mr. Thompson, to continue exploring specific details and potential evidence. No objection. Mr. Anderson, are you available for a follow-up session within the next week?  Yes, I am available. Please let me know the details when you've scheduled it Mr. Anderson, since our last session, have you had any time to review Acme Corporation's employee handbook pertaining to the complaint process for potential discrimination?  Yes, I have. Can you briefly describe the steps outlined in the handbook for filing a complaint based on potential discrimination?  The handbook mentioned employees could submit a written complaint to the Human Resources department or verbally report it to an HR representative or any manager. However, specific details about the investigation process or resolution options were quite vague. Mr. Anderson, did the employee handbook specify who constitutes a \"manager\" authorized to receive such initial verbal complaints?  No, it didn't provide any specific details about which managers were included in that definition or if all managers were authorized to receive such reports. Mr. Anderson, you previously mentioned frustration with receiving similar design concepts to yours being chosen over your own work while working at Acme. Do you still have copies of these original design concepts and the final versions ultimately used?  Unfortunately, I didn't retain individual copies of every design iteration. However, I did maintain some preliminary sketches and digital drafts from several projects, including the one discussed earlier related to the 2023 product launch campaign. Would you be willing to provide these materials as potential evidence in this case?  Yes, I can bring them to the next session. Mr. Anderson, are you aware of other colleagues who may have retained copies of their rejected design projects or drafts during their employment at Acme?  I'm not certain, but I remember several colleagues raising concerns about the inconsistent feedback and selection process for design concepts. It's possible some of them might have kept records for their own reference. We will look into that possibility. Mr. Anderson, during your time at Acme, did you ever meet or hear about any employees who filed official complaints based on experiencing discrimination?  Not officially. As mentioned earlier, there was an underlying lack of transparency and open communication around potentially sensitive topics like discrimination. Therefore, it was difficult to know for sure. Mr. Anderson, did you receive any additional training or workshops related to diversity and inclusion since leaving Acme Corporation?  Yes, my current employer offers comprehensive training programs and workshops regarding diversity and inclusion as part of their ongoing commitment to a fair and equitable work environment. Do you find these additional training programs and the overall work environment at your current company to be beneficial compared to your experience at Acme?  Absolutely. The focus on creating a safe space for open communication, valuing diverse perspectives, and providing equal opportunities for growth has been incredibly positive and empowering. No further questions at this time. Mr. Anderson, as mentioned previously, we would like you to bring copies of the design materials you retained for the next session. Additionally, I may reach out to inquire about potential colleagues who might have kept similar records. Is that alright?  That's perfectly fine. Please let me know if you need anything else in the meantime. Mr. Anderson, one final question before we adjourn. You mentioned feeling hesitant to bring up your concerns to your supervisor after their dismissive response. Did their reaction specifically mention any consequences of raising the potential bias issue?  Not directly. There wasn't an explicit threat of any sort. However, their dismissive tone and the implication that my concerns weren't valid created an atmosphere where I felt further discussion would be futile and potentially disadvantageous. Objection, speculation about the witness's interpretation of a supervisor's tone is not based on facts. Reframing, Mr. Anderson. How did your supervisor's response make you feel about the potential consequences of reporting your concerns?  Their response discouraged me and made me feel unheard. It conveyed the impression that my concerns about potential bias wouldn't be taken seriously and could potentially hinder my career progression within the company.
