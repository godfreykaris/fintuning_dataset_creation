What did you have done at Johns Hopkins on\nLine 20, 18:59:55: December 7th? '\nLine 21, 18:59:55: A. It's called a stellate, S-T-E-L-L-A-G-E,\nLine 22, 18:59:55: ganglion, G-A-L-L-I-O-N, blockage.

And what's the purpose of that?\nLine 7, 18:59:55: A. It deadens the nerves, because what\nLine 8, 18:59:55: happens is when you have severe nerve damage, it's\nLine 9, 18:59:55: like electrical impulses going off. It's like\nLine 10, 18:59:55: taking a cord and fraying it and all the electrical ;\nLine 11, 18:59:55: impulses going all over the place. That's what\nLine 12, 18:59:55: causes the pain in the tissues, so what they do is :\nLine 13, 18:59:55: they block it off so it doesn't go down that far.\nLine 14, 18:59:55: It just leaves an even line. |\nLine 15, 18:59:55: Q.

There was some damage done\nLine 10, 18:59:41: to the motor of the car, I think, because I had to\nLine 11, 18:59:41: take it back to Thompson Dodge because it was doing\nLine 12, 18:59:41: so much rattling, and they had to do something to\nLine 13, 18:59:41: the steering.\nLine 14, 18:59:41: Q. Okay.

So in other words, trying to perceive what\nLine 11, 18:59:44: happened, it wasn't like the truck was sort of\nLine 12, 18:59:44: sliding over to the right?\nLine 13, 18:59:44: A.

I mean, I was holding onto\nLine 7, 18:59:44: the steering wheel, and I don't know what happened.\nLine 8, 18:59:44: I mean, it just, the impact, because I mean, he just\nLine 9, 18:59:44: came in over my, just came in front of me, and it\nLine 10, 18:59:44: was like boom. There was no stopping. There was\nLine 11, 18:59:44: nowhere I could just, just slam on the brakes or\nLine 12, 18:59:44: anything. There was no -- it was there.

I'm just estimating, because I had went in\nLine 13, 18:59:55: for Qa, \u00abGUERIN nad wanted me to see a\nLine 14, 18:59:55: all> who specializes in pain management so\nLine 15, 18:59:55: they could do some ganglion stellate blockages to :\nLine 16, 18:59:55: stop the nerve endings from the pain that they were |\nLine 17, 18:59:55: causing, and I had that done at Johns Hopkins on\nLine 18, 18:59:55: December 7th.\nLine 19, 18:59:55: Q. What did you have done at Johns Hopkins on\nLine 20, 18:59:55: December 7th? '\nLine 21, 18:59:55: A. It's called a stellate, S-T-E-L-L-A-G-E,\nLine 22, 18:59:55: ganglion, G-A-L-L-I-O-N, blockage.

And what's the purpose of that?\nLine 7, 18:59:55: A. It deadens the nerves, because what\nLine 8, 18:59:55: happens is when you have severe nerve damage, it's\nLine 9, 18:59:55: like electrical impulses going off. It's like\nLine 10, 18:59:55: taking a cord and fraying it and all the electrical ;\nLine 11, 18:59:55: impulses going all over the place. That's what\nLine 12, 18:59:55: causes the pain in the tissues, so what they do is :\nLine 13, 18:59:55: they block it off so it doesn't go down that far.\nLine 14, 18:59:55: It just leaves an even line. |\nLine 15, 18:59:55: Q.

It became clear to me that further advancement\nLine 23, 19:01:36: opportunities within the company were unlikely.\nLine 24, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: That's all my questions at this time.\nLine 25, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, during your time at Acme, did you ever receive any negative performance\nLine 26, 19:01:36: reviews or warnings related to your work performance?\nLine 27, 19:01:36: Witness: No, as mentioned before, my performance reviews were always positive.\nLine 28, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Did you ever attend any diversity and inclusion training offered by Acme during your\nLine 29, 19:01:36: employment?\nLine 30, 19:01:36: Witness: I did participate in the mandatory online training modules, but there weren't any specific\nLine 31, 19:01:36: training sessions related to addressing or reporting potentially discriminatory situations within the\nLine 32, 19:01:36: company.\nLine 33, 19:01:36: Summary\n--- End of Page 3 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 4 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:36: Michael Anderson details specific incidents supporting his feeling of being undervalued based on his\nLine 2, 19:01:36: protected category. He describes colleagues disregarding his ideas and being passed over for\nLine 3, 19:01:36: promotions despite comparable qualifications. He provides a specific example from the 2023 product\nLine 4, 19:01:36: launch where his design was overlooked in favor of a male colleague's similar work. He mentions\nLine 5, 19:01:36: mentioning his concerns to his supervisor but being discouraged from pursuing them. He clarifies his\nLine 6, 19:01:36: decision to leave Acme was due to the lack of advancement opportunities, not performance or personal\nLine 7, 19:01:36: reasons. Ms. Garcia then establishes that Mr. Anderson's performance was consistently good and that\nLine 8, 19:01:36: he participated in available diversity training while at Acme, though specific training for addressing\nLine 9, 19:01:36: potential discrimination was absent.\nLine 10, 19:01:36: Deposition:\nLine 11, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, are you aware of Acme's anti-discrimination policy or how complaints of\nLine 12, 19:01:36: discrimination are addressed within the company?\nLine 13, 19:01:36: Witness: I reviewed the employee handbook, which did explain the existence of an anti-discrimination\nLine 14, 19:01:36: policy. However, I was unsure of the specific complaint process at the time\nLine 15, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you elaborate on why you felt apprehensive about bringing up these\nLine 16, 19:01:36: incidents to your supervisor despite feeling uncomfortable and undervalued?\nLine 17, 19:01:36: Witness: Honestly, there were a few reasons. Firstly, as I mentioned, when I did hint at feeling\nLine 18, 19:01:36: undervalued to my supervisor, their dismissive response discouraged me from further discussions. It\nLine 19, 19:01:36: seemed like they weren't receptive to hearing about any potential issues.\nLine 20, 19:01:36: Secondly, there was a general company culture that made me hesitant to speak up. Younger male\nLine 21, 19:01:36: colleagues often dominated conversations and presentations, and there weren't many women in senior\nLine 22, 19:01:36: positions within the marketing department. It felt like my voice wouldn't be heard or even worse, that\nLine 23, 19:01:36: bringing forward complaints might lead to retaliation or hinder my career further.\nLine 24, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Did you notice any specific instances of retaliation against other employees who may have\nLine 25, 19:01:36: raised complaints or concerns about work environment issues?\nLine 26, 19:01:36: Witness: While I can't say for sure, there was one colleague, Sarah Lopez, who openly challenged gender\nLine 27, 19:01:36: bias during a department meeting but was subsequently given less desirable project assignments\nLine 28, 19:01:36: compared to her male colleagues. This incident definitely reinforced my concerns about potentially\nLine 29, 19:01:36: facing a similar situation.**\nLine 30, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: Objection, speculation about an unrelated case is irrelevant to the present matter.\nLine 31, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Withdrawn. Mr. Anderson, did you ever discuss your concerns about potential bias or lack of\nLine 32, 19:01:36: promotion opportunities with any human resources personnel at Acme?\nLine 33, 19:01:36: Witness: No, I didn't. As I mentioned before, the lack of clarity on the specific complaint process\nLine 34, 19:01:36: combined with the overall culture discouraged me from pursuing that route.\nLine 35, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, since leaving Acme, have you sought employment elsewhere?\n--- End of Page 4 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 5 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, I am currently employed at a different company and feel much more valued and respected\nLine 2, 19:01:37: in my current role. The work environment is significantly more inclusive, and I regularly receive positive\nLine 3, 19:01:37: feedback and opportunities for professional development.\nLine 4, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, how has your experience at Acme impacted you personally and\nLine 5, 19:01:37: professionally?\nLine 6, 19:01:37: Witness: It was definitely a frustrating and discouraging experience. It felt like my hard work and\nLine 7, 19:01:37: qualifications weren't being recognized fairly, leading to some self-doubt and a sense of being\nLine 8, 19:01:37: undervalued. However, finding a new and positive work environment has helped me rebuild my\nLine 9, 19:01:37: confidence and refocus on my career goals.\nLine 10, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: I have no further questions.\nLine 11, 19:01:37: Summary\nLine 12, 19:01:37: This segment explores Mr. Anderson's reasons for not formally complaining despite feeling undervalued.\nLine 13, 19:01:37: He reiterates his supervisor's dismissive response and the perceived lack of receptiveness within the\nLine 14, 19:01:37: company culture. He describes a specific instance where a colleague who challenged gender bias faced\nLine 15, 19:01:37: negative consequences, reinforcing his fear of retaliation. He clarifies that he didn't pursue HR due to\nLine 16, 19:01:37: unclear procedures and the discouraging company culture. Finally, he highlights his positive experience\nLine 17, 19:01:37: at a new company, emphasizing feelings of value, inclusion, and professional growth in contrast to his\nLine 18, 19:01:37: experience at Acme. He concludes by acknowledging the frustration and self-doubt from Acme but also\nLine 19, 19:01:37: the positive impact of finding a supportive work environment.\nLine 20, 19:01:37: Deposition\nLine 21, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: I have one final question. Mr. Anderson, is there anything else you would like to add\nLine 22, 19:01:37: regarding your experience at Acme Corporation?\nLine 23, 19:01:37: Witness: Just that I hope by sharing my story, it can contribute to fostering a more diverse and inclusive\nLine 24, 19:01:37: work environment at Acme for future employees. Everyone deserves to feel valued and respected in\nLine 25, 19:01:37: their workplace, regardless of their [protected category].\nLine 26, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Interesting point, Mr. Anderson. Ms. Garcia, while you have no further questions, I'd like\nLine 27, 19:01:37: to explore some aspects of Mr. Anderson's experience further before concluding the deposition.\nLine 28, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: No objection. Please proceed, Mr. Thompson.\nLine 29, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, you mentioned feeling unsure about the specific complaint process at\nLine 30, 19:01:37: Acme. Did you take any steps to learn more about it after your meeting with your supervisor?\nLine 31, 19:01:37: Witness: No, I didn't feel comfortable approaching my supervisor again after their dismissive response.\nLine 32, 19:01:37: Additionally, I recall the employee handbook being quite lengthy, and finding specific information about\nLine 33, 19:01:37: the complaint process proved difficult at the time.\n--- End of Page 5 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 6 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: You mentioned a colleague, Sarah Lopez, who voiced concerns about gender bias. Did\nLine 2, 19:01:37: you ever speak to her directly about her experience and the alleged retaliation she faced?\nLine 3, 19:01:37: Witness: Briefly, yes. We expressed our mutual frustrations and the feeling of being undervalued within\nLine 4, 19:01:37: the department. However, we were both hesitant to pursue any formal complaints due to the\nLine 5, 19:01:37: aforementioned concerns about the company culture and potential retaliation.\nLine 6, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Did you ever discuss the issue of lack of promotion opportunities with any other\nLine 7, 19:01:37: colleagues, particularly women in the marketing department?\nLine 8, 19:01:37: Witness: Not directly. While there were a few women colleagues in the department, none of them were\nLine 9, 19:01:37: in senior positions. The general environment discouraged open communication about potentially\nLine 10, 19:01:37: sensitive topics like discrimination.\nLine 11, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Thompson, I object to leading the witness. Can you rephrase your question and allow\nLine 12, 19:01:37: Mr. Anderson to answer in his own words?\nLine 13, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Apologies, Ms. Garcia. Mr. Anderson, to clarify, did you have any informal conversations\nLine 14, 19:01:37: with other colleagues about your concerns regarding promotion opportunities or potential gender bias\nLine 15, 19:01:37: within the marketing department at Acme?\nLine 16, 19:01:37: Witness: There weren't any specific discussions about promotions or bias, but the general atmosphere\nLine 17, 19:01:37: around the lack of female representation in senior positions was a frequent topic of quiet observation\nLine 18, 19:01:37: amongst some female colleagues. We felt implicit pressure to work harder and prove ourselves more\nLine 19, 19:01:37: than our male colleagues, but reaching leadership positions seemed like an increasingly distant\nLine 20, 19:01:37: prospect.\nLine 21, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you elaborate on what kind of \"pressure\" you felt, and was there any\nLine 22, 19:01:37: specific instance or behavior from colleagues or superiors that made you feel this way?\nLine 23, 19:01:37: Summary\nLine 24, 19:01:37: In the concluding segment, Mr. Anderson expresses hope that his experience can contribute to a more\nLine 25, 19:01:37: inclusive work environment at Acme. Mr. Thompson then delves deeper into specific aspects of Mr.\nLine 26, 19:01:37: Anderson's experience:\nLine 27, 19:01:37: Complaint process: Mr. Anderson cites discomfort following his supervisor's reaction and difficulty\nLine 28, 19:01:37: navigating the lengthy employee handbook as reasons for not seeking further information.\nLine 29, 19:01:37: Colleague's experience: He mentions briefly discussing his frustrations and concerns with Sarah Lopez\nLine 30, 19:01:37: but clarifies their shared hesitation to pursue formal complaints due to company culture concerns.\nLine 31, 19:01:37: Promotion opportunities and gender bias: He explains the lack of open communication about these\nLine 32, 19:01:37: issues and feeling unspoken pressure due to the absence of women in senior positions, though no\nLine 33, 19:01:37: specific discussions on bias occurred.\nLine 34, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia objects to a leading question about bias, and Mr. Thompson rephrases, allowing Mr.\nLine 35, 19:01:37: Anderson to clarify further. He explains the silent observation among female colleagues of the lack of\n--- End of Page 6 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 7 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:37: female leadership and the perceived need to overachieve compared to male colleagues. Ms. Garcia\nLine 2, 19:01:37: requests further details about the pressure felt by Mr. Anderson.\nLine 3, 19:01:37: Deposition\nLine 4, 19:01:37: Witness: It wasn't any direct confrontation or statement, but more of a subtle feeling arising from\nLine 5, 19:01:37: observing the lack of female representation in leadership roles combined with certain comments about\nLine 6, 19:01:37: needing to \"work harder\" or \"prove myself\" despite my consistent positive performance reviews.\nLine 7, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Thank you, Mr. Anderson. These are valuable insights. Do you have any further\nLine 8, 19:01:37: questions, Ms. Garcia?\nLine 9, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: (after reviewing her notes) I have a few follow-up questions for clarification. However, due\nLine 10, 19:01:37: to the time constraints, I would like to schedule a follow-up session at your earliest convenience, Mr.\nLine 11, 19:01:37: Thompson, to continue exploring specific details and potential evidence.\nLine 12, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: No objection. Mr. Anderson, are you available for a follow-up session within the next\nLine 13, 19:01:37: week?\nLine 14, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, I am available. Please let me know the details when you've scheduled it\nLine 15, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, since our last session, have you had any time to review Acme\nLine 16, 19:01:37: Corporation's employee handbook pertaining to the complaint process for potential discrimination?\nLine 17, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, I have.\nLine 18, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Can you briefly describe the steps outlined in the handbook for filing a complaint based\nLine 19, 19:01:37: on potential discrimination?\nLine 20, 19:01:37: Witness: The handbook mentioned employees could submit a written complaint to the Human\nLine 21, 19:01:37: Resources department or verbally report it to an HR representative or any manager. However, specific\nLine 22, 19:01:37: details about the investigation process or resolution options were quite vague.\nLine 23, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, did the employee handbook specify who constitutes a \"manager\" authorized\nLine 24, 19:01:37: to receive such initial verbal complaints?\nLine 25, 19:01:37: Witness: No, it didn't provide any specific details about which managers were included in that definition\nLine 26, 19:01:37: or if all managers were authorized to receive such reports.\nLine 27, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, you previously mentioned frustration with receiving similar design\nLine 28, 19:01:37: concepts to yours being chosen over your own work while working at Acme. Do you still have copies of\nLine 29, 19:01:37: these original design concepts and the final versions ultimately used?\nLine 30, 19:01:37: Witness: Unfortunately, I didn't retain individual copies of every design iteration. However, I did\nLine 31, 19:01:37: maintain some preliminary sketches and digital drafts from several projects, including the one discussed\nLine 32, 19:01:37: earlier related to the 2023 product launch campaign.\nLine 33, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Would you be willing to provide these materials as potential evidence in this case?\nLine 34, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, I can bring them to the next session.\n--- End of Page 7 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 8 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, are you aware of other colleagues who may have retained copies of their\nLine 2, 19:01:37: rejected design projects or drafts during their employment at Acme?\nLine 3, 19:01:37: Witness: I'm not certain, but I remember several colleagues raising concerns about the inconsistent\nLine 4, 19:01:37: feedback and selection process for design concepts. It's possible some of them might have kept records\nLine 5, 19:01:37: for their own reference.\nLine 6, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: We will look into that possibility. Mr. Anderson, during your time at Acme, did you ever\nLine 7, 19:01:37: meet or hear about any employees who filed official complaints based on experiencing discrimination?\nLine 8, 19:01:37: Witness: Not officially. As mentioned earlier, there was an underlying lack of transparency and open\nLine 9, 19:01:37: communication around potentially sensitive topics like discrimination. Therefore, it was difficult to know\nLine 10, 19:01:37: for sure.\nLine 11, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, did you receive any additional training or workshops related to diversity and\nLine 12, 19:01:37: inclusion since leaving Acme Corporation?\nLine 13, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, my current employer offers comprehensive training programs and workshops regarding\nLine 14, 19:01:37: diversity and inclusion as part of their ongoing commitment to a fair and equitable work environment.\nLine 15, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Do you find these additional training programs and the overall work environment at\nLine 16, 19:01:37: your current company to be beneficial compared to your experience at Acme?\nLine 17, 19:01:37: Witness: Absolutely. The focus on creating a safe space for open communication, valuing diverse\nLine 18, 19:01:37: perspectives, and providing equal opportunities for growth has been incredibly positive and\nLine 19, 19:01:37: empowering.\nLine 20, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: No further questions at this time.\nLine 21, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, as mentioned previously, we would like you to bring copies of the design\nLine 22, 19:01:37: materials you retained for the next session. Additionally, I may reach out to inquire about potential\nLine 23, 19:01:37: colleagues who might have kept similar records. Is that alright?\nLine 24, 19:01:37: Witness: That's perfectly fine. Please let me know if you need anything else in the meantime.\nLine 25, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, one final question before we adjourn. You mentioned feeling hesitant to\nLine 26, 19:01:37: bring up your concerns to your supervisor after their dismissive response. Did their reaction specifically\nLine 27, 19:01:37: mention any consequences of raising the potential bias issue?\nLine 28, 19:01:37: Witness: Not directly. There wasn't an explicit threat of any sort. However, their dismissive tone and the\nLine 29, 19:01:37: implication that my concerns weren't valid created an atmosphere where I felt further discussion would\nLine 30, 19:01:37: be futile and potentially disadvantageous.\nLine 31, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Objection, speculation about the witness's interpretation of a supervisor's tone is not based\nLine 32, 19:01:37: on facts.\nLine 33, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Reframing, Mr. Anderson. How did your supervisor's response make you feel about the\nLine 34, 19:01:37: potential consequences of reporting your concerns?\n--- End of Page 8 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 9 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:38: Witness: Their response discouraged me and made me feel unheard. It conveyed the impression that my\nLine 2, 19:01:38: concerns about potential bias wouldn't be taken seriously and could potentially hinder my career\nLine 3, 19:01:38: progression within the company.\nLine 4, 19:01:38: Summary\nLine 5, 19:01:38: The concluding segment addresses further details and sets the stage for a follow-up session:\nLine 6, 19:01:38: Complaint process: Mr. Anderson reviews the handbook and describes the outlined steps for filing a\nLine 7, 19:01:38: complaint, noting the vagueness regarding investigation and resolution. Ms. Garcia highlights the lack of\nLine 8, 19:01:38: clarity on who qualifies as a \"manager\" authorized to receive initial verbal reports.\nLine 9, 19:01:38: Design concepts: Mr. Anderson clarifies he still possesses some preliminary sketches and drafts,\nLine 10, 19:01:38: including those from the 2023 product launch, and agrees to provide them as potential evidence. Mr.\nLine 11, 19:01:38: Thompson expresses interest in exploring the possibility of other colleagues retaining similar materials.\nLine 12, 19:01:38: Official complaints: Mr. Anderson reiterates the lack of knowledge about any official discrimination\nLine 13, 19:01:38: complaints at Acme due to the previously mentioned culture of secrecy.\nLine 14, 19:01:38: Current company: Mr. Anderson confirms receiving additional diversity and inclusion training at his\nLine 15, 19:01:38: current company. He emphasizes the positive aspects of his new work environment, highlighting open\nLine 16, 19:01:38: communication, valuing diverse perspectives, and equal opportunities, contrasting it with his experience\nLine 17, 19:01:38: at Acme.\nLine 18, 19:01:38: Follow-up: Both parties agree to a follow-up session. Mr. Thompson clarifies his intention to request the\nLine 19, 19:01:38: design materials and potentially contact other colleagues. Ms. Garcia objects to the witness's\nLine 20, 19:01:38: interpretation of his supervisor's tone, leading Mr. Thompson to rephrase the question, to which Mr.\nLine 21, 19:01:38: Anderson reiterates feeling discouraged and unheard, fearing his concerns wouldn't be taken seriously\nLine 22, 19:01:38: and could hinder his career.\nLine 23, 19:01:38: Deposition\nLine 24, 19:01:38: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Thompson, I believe we've covered the essential topics for today. However, as these are\nLine 25, 19:01:38: complex claims, I would appreciate the opportunity to review the transcript and potentially ask further\nLine 26, 19:01:38: questions at a future session, should any need arise.\nLine 27, 19:01:38: Mr. Thompson: No objection. Mr. Anderson, as Ms. Garcia mentioned, we appreciate your willingness to\nLine 28, 19:01:38: cooperate and provide additional materials. We will be in touch to schedule a follow-up session if\nLine 29, 19:01:38: needed.\nLine 30, 19:01:38: Witness: Understood.\nLine 31, 19:01:38: Summary\nLine 32, 19:01:38: The deposition concludes with Ms. Garcia expressing a desire to review the transcript and potentially\nLine 33, 19:01:38: ask further questions in a future session if needed. Mr. Thompson agrees, and both thank Mr. Anderson\nLine 34, 19:01:38: for his cooperation and willingness to provide additional materials. Mr. Anderson acknowledges their\nLine 35, 19:01:38: communication and awaits further information regarding a potential follow-up session.\n--- End of Page 9 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 10 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:38: Deposition\nLine 2, 19:01:38: MILLER: A driver is obligated to pay attention to the road and yield to other drivers when required. Let\nLine 3, 19:01:38: me take you back to what happened on April 20th, 2022. The Defendant, who was an attorney for the\nLine 4, 19:01:38: IRS, was driving her usual route to work. She drove down Annapolis Road to take a left onto another\nLine 5, 19:01:38: road.\nLine 6, 19:01:38: (Could we have the next slide, please?) She was driving down this road\u2026 can everyone see this? She\nLine 7, 19:01:38: stopped at a light on a clear day. While stopped, she reached down to find her parking pass.\nLine 8, 19:01:38: DEFENSE LAWYER: May we approach?\nLine 9, 19:01:38: THE COURT: Yes.\nLine 10, 19:01:38: BENCH CONFERENCE\nLine 11, 19:01:38: (Bench Conference begins \u2013 10:26:39m.)\nLine 12, 19:01:38: (The parties approach the bench for a discussion.)\nLine 13, 19:01:38: THE COURT: By court ruling, liability has been established. The focus of this case is only on damages. I\nLine 14, 19:01:38: understand why we\u2019re discussing these details, but it\u2019s about damages.\nLine 15, 19:01:38: MILLER: I\u2019m setting the scene for the accident because her damages are part of the accident narrative.\nLine 16, 19:01:38: DEFENSE LAWYER: We\u2019re only discussing the fact that an accident happened and a person was injured.\nLine 17, 19:01:38: The details about reaching and negligence seem to be evidence of liability.\nLine 18, 19:01:38: THE COURT: I understand. It\u2019s your opening statement, so I\u2019ll give you some leeway.\nLine 19, 19:01:38: MILLER: I\u2019m just providing context. I\u2019ll be getting into the damages soon.\nLine 20, 19:01:38: THE COURT: Alright.\nLine 21, 19:01:38: (Bench Conference concluded \u2013 10:27:32 m.)\nLine 22, 19:01:38: (The parties return to their places.)\nLine 23, 19:01:38: MILLER: The Defendant heard a horn beep and took a left turn. She didn\u2019t see the Plaintiff, who had the\nLine 24, 19:01:38: right of way, coming from the opposite direction. Due to the collision, the Plaintiff\u2019s ankle was broken\nLine 25, 19:01:38: and required surgery.\nLine 26, 19:01:38: Take a look at these images. The first one shows her ankle before surgery, the second one after surgery.\nLine 27, 19:01:38: Today, she still has 15 screws and three plates in her ankle. She will never be able to run again and\nLine 28, 19:01:38: standing for extended periods of time is difficult.\nLine 29, 19:01:38: We\u2019ve brought this case before you because of the harm caused to the Plaintiff. We needed to agree\nLine 30, 19:01:38: that the Defendant was at fault for the accident, which she has accepted. We also had to understand the\nLine 31, 19:01:38: extent and implications of the Plaintiff\u2019s damages, not just the initial injury and surgery, but also its long-\nLine 32, 19:01:38: term impact on her life.\nLine 33, 19:01:38: To do this, we spoke to her doctors, her husband, her friends, and even her employer. One of her\nLine 34, 19:01:38: doctors is going to talk to you.\n--- End of Page 10 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 11 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:38: This is the guy to see if something awful like this is going to happen to your ankle. He received an Ivy\nLine 2, 19:01:38: League education and, at one point, was the chief of foot and ankle orthopedic injuries at Johns\nLine 3, 19:01:38: Hopkins. He consults for the Baltimore Orioles. His resume, I want to say, is as long as your arm, but it\u2019s\nLine 4, 19:01:38: actually a lot longer than that.\nLine 5, 19:01:38: We\u2019re going to bring him to talk to you guys, in a very 2023 way. It\u2019s going to be by videotape, so his\nLine 6, 19:01:38: testimony will be by videotape, but it holds the same force as if it was at trial, and he came here to see\nLine 7, 19:01:38: us. And, of course, my partner Laura Zois and the defense attorney had an opportunity to ask him\nLine 8, 19:01:38: questions.\nLine 9, 19:01:38: He\u2019s going to tell you she still has 15 screws and three plates in her ankle holding everything together.\nLine 10, 19:01:38: The problem with that is that it creates a breeding ground for arthritis, and this 33-year-old woman\nLine 11, 19:01:38: already has the signs of arthritis. At some point, she\u2019s going to need what\u2019s called a fusion, which will\nLine 12, 19:01:38: stabilize her ankle. The bad news is, you can\u2019t move it once it locks, so you no longer have the ability to\nLine 13, 19:01:38: bend.\nLine 14, 19:01:38: This trial is about the harms and losses that she has suffered and endured as the result of this accident.\nLine 15, 19:01:38: This is not a case about sympathy. You should not award her damages because you feel sorry for her.\nLine 16, 19:01:38: You\u2019re going to hear about how the accident has impacted her professional and personal life.\nLine 17, 19:01:38: At the time of the crash, they were a very young family. They were an energetic family. This is an active\nLine 18, 19:01:38: family with four kids doing everything you can imagine, Six Flags, the park. They would run together.\nLine 19, 19:01:38: They played basketball together. They traveled everywhere, New York, Baltimore, Washington, DC. They\nLine 20, 19:01:38: were just a very active family.\nLine 21, 19:01:38: And she also had a vibrant social life. She was a hairstylist, and she loved that job. It was her social outlet\nLine 22, 19:01:38: beside her kids. She would do the church choir every Wednesday, and still found times to go out and see\nLine 23, 19:01:38: her family. She\u2019s still fighting with her family, but it\u2019s hard.\nLine 24, 19:01:38: She can\u2019t work as a hairstylist anymore. So what did she do? She went back to school to the University\nLine 25, 19:01:38: of Maryland. She\u2019s working, getting very close to getting her degree. She\u2019s still fighting. She has four kids\nLine 26, 19:01:38: they\u2019re chasing around.\nLine 27, 19:01:38: Let\u2019s go back and talk about how it ended up. Let\u2019s talk about the accident. She had this awful crash and\nLine 28, 19:01:38: needed emergency surgery where they put in these screws. She had a nine-month-old baby, along with\nLine 29, 19:01:38: three other kids. She and the two girls, the younger ones, went to live with her mom. Her mom took\nLine 30, 19:01:38: care of her and the girls, while her husband took care of the other kids.\nLine 31, 19:01:38: This has been a massive disruption to their lives. The accident has completely changed her life, and it\u2019s\nLine 32, 19:01:38: reflected in every facet of her day-to-day. Her job, her family life, her hobbies, everything she used to\nLine 33, 19:01:38: take pleasure in has been impacted in one way or another. And the evidence in this case will show these\nLine 34, 19:01:38: changes are likely to persist for the rest of her life.\nLine 35, 19:01:38: We ask you to consider the totality of these changes, the persistent harm and loss she\u2019s suffered and\nLine 36, 19:01:38: will continue to suffer, as a direct result of the accident. We ask you to consider these when coming to a\nLine 37, 19:01:38: decision in this case.\n--- End of Page 11 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 12 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:38: This accident, however, led to an upheaval in their lives. About a month after the accident, she managed\nLine 2, 19:01:38: to return home with the kids. Her mother, an FDA employee, took three months off work to care for her,\nLine 3, 19:01:38: her daughter, and her grandchildren. The accident wreaked havoc on their lives.\nLine 4, 19:01:38: She endured six months of rigorous physical therapy and another operation. While it was painful and\nLine 5, 19:01:38: difficult, the effort was worthwhile as it improved her condition, especially her ankle, though we wish\nLine 6, 19:01:38: she had recovered more.\nLine 7, 19:01:38: As we delve into this case, it\u2019s about the harm and losses experienced. We will ask you to make amends\nLine 8, 19:01:38: where possible and provide compensation for the irreparable harm. The damages can be categorized\nLine 9, 19:01:38: into three parts: her medical bills, the post-accident trauma suffered by her and her family, and the pain\nLine 10, 19:01:38: she will endure for the expected next 45 years of her life.\nLine 11, 19:01:38: She was a spontaneous person, fond of making impromptu plans like going to Virginia Beach over the\nLine 12, 19:01:38: weekend or heading to the park. Now, every activity revolves around her ability to reach there, her\nLine 13, 19:01:38: mobility, and whether she can tolerate the pain during the trip. This situation has affected her and her\nLine 14, 19:01:38: four kids, as well as her husband.\nLine 15, 19:01:38: The court wants to clarify that the evidence and testimonies from the witness stand are what will\nLine 16, 19:01:38: control your deliberations. Opening statements and closing arguments of lawyers do not constitute\nLine 17, 19:01:38: evidence.\nLine 18, 19:01:38: This case is not just about the suffering of their children or her husband. It\u2019s about the impact of their\nLine 19, 19:01:38: suffering on her. We will ask you to consider an amount that may seem high at the beginning. But we\nLine 20, 19:01:38: believe that after hearing all the evidence, you\u2019ll find it to be a fair compensation for her losses and\nLine 21, 19:01:38: harm. The amount we suggest is $1.1 million.\nLine 22, 19:01:38: Defense Opening Statement\nLine 23, 19:01:38: Regarding the defendant, they acknowledge the responsibility for the accident and that it was their\nLine 24, 19:01:38: fault. The case is for you to determine the appropriate damages. The injury is severe, and they ask for an\nLine 25, 19:01:38: extraordinary amount of compensation.\nLine 26, 19:01:38: She broke her ankle, which was repaired surgically with plates and screws. There was a second surgery\nLine 27, 19:01:38: due to loosening of the screws, which were then removed. She attended physical therapy, which\nLine 28, 19:01:38: improved her ability to move her ankle. Whether she will need surgery in the future is uncertain.\nLine 29, 19:01:38: The past medical expenses are around $36,505, which we don\u2019t contest. Her lost wages due to the\nLine 30, 19:01:38: accident are around $3,400 to $3,500. These are not the focal points of this case. The main issue is the\nLine 31, 19:01:38: amount to be awarded for non-economic damages, for which we request something fair, reasonable,\nLine 32, 19:01:38: and sensible.\nLine 33, 19:01:38: Thank you for your time and attention, and we hope to conclude this case promptly.\nLine 34, 19:01:38: Testimony of Victim\u2019s Husband\nLine 35, 19:01:38: Mr. Miller: Good morning. Can I have your address?\nLine 36, 19:01:38: SJ: Certainly.\nLine 37, 19:01:38: Mr. Miller: How long have you lived at that address?\n--- End of Page 12 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 13 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: SJ: I bought the house in 2003, so it\u2019s been approximately ten years.\nLine 2, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Who lives there with you?\nLine 3, 19:01:39: SJ: My wife, and our four children.\nLine 4, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Can you tell the jury how old your children are and their names?\nLine 5, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes. My children are 13, and the others are\u2026\nLine 6, 19:01:39: The Honorable Judge: Please continue.\nLine 7, 19:01:39: SJ: \u2026five, and three.\nLine 8, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: I understand. And for some background, what do you do for a living?\nLine 9, 19:01:39: SJ: I\u2019m currently the general manager at Oreck Clean Home Center.\nLine 10, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: And where are these locations?\nLine 11, 19:01:39: SJ: We have six locations in Maryland and Virginia.\nLine 12, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: What are your responsibilities at work?\nLine 13, 19:01:39: SJ: I oversee all six stores and manage one of them.\nLine 14, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Can you describe your work schedule?\nLine 15, 19:01:39: SJ: I work Monday through Saturday, from 10:00 am to 7:00 pm. Often, I work seven days a week which\nLine 16, 19:01:39: means working on Sundays from 12:00 pm to 5:00 pm.\nLine 17, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: How do you feel about those hours?\nLine 18, 19:01:39: SJ: They are long, but I need to work to support my family.\nLine 19, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: How long have you known your wife?\nLine 20, 19:01:39: SJ: I met her in 1993, she was my sister\u2019s best friend.\nLine 21, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: You mean your wife was your sister\u2019s best friend?\nLine 22, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes, I apologize for the confusion. She was indeed my sister\u2019s best friend.\nLine 23, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Let\u2019s move to another topic. Do you remember the car accident your wife was in 2022?\nLine 24, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes, I do.\nLine 25, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Prior to the accident, can you describe your household?\nLine 26, 19:01:39: SJ: Our household was what I would consider the perfect life. My wife and children were happy and\nLine 27, 19:01:39: always engaged in activities. We used to take vacations and attend family reunions.\nLine 28, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Was your wife a spontaneous person or a planner?\nLine 29, 19:01:39: SJ: She was more spontaneous, always ready to take on new activities.\n--- End of Page 13 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 14 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Could you describe her for the jury?\nLine 2, 19:01:39: SJ: She is always happy, loves socializing and helping people. She attended choir rehearsal, Bible study\nLine 3, 19:01:39: every week, and also took care of our four children.\nLine 4, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: What was her job at the time of the crash?\nLine 5, 19:01:39: SJ: She was the assistant manager of a hair salon.\nLine 6, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Did she enjoy her work?\nLine 7, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes, she loved her work. It was part of her identity.\nLine 8, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Did your wife\u2019s demeanor change after the car accident?\nLine 9, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes, after the accident everything changed. Our family life and activity level changed significantly. She\nLine 10, 19:01:39: used to take the children to sporting events and practice basketball. Now, she can\u2019t do these activities.\nLine 11, 19:01:39: She no longer goes on family vacations. My two older sons call her \u201cboring\u201d now because of her reduced\nLine 12, 19:01:39: activity level. The accident has restricted her capabilities and as a result, she can\u2019t even do simple tasks\nLine 13, 19:01:39: like carrying laundry baskets or standing up to cook. Our family life has changed drastically since the\nLine 14, 19:01:39: accident.\nLine 15, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Has your wife gone back to work since the accident?\nLine 16, 19:01:39: SJ: She tried to help a friend out a couple of months ago at her hair salon, but it ended with her in a lot\nLine 17, 19:01:39: of pain due to the swelling in her ankle.\nLine 18, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: I have here a picture you received from your wife. Is this the picture she sent you?\nLine 19, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Can you tell us how your wife\u2019s personal social life has been affected since the crash?\nLine 20, 19:01:39: SJ: Her social life has indeed changed significantly. Before the accident, she would regularly go out with\nLine 21, 19:01:39: friends, engage in dancing, and other social activities. However, the constant pain and discomfort after\nLine 22, 19:01:39: the crash have made such activities impossible. Her social life is definitely not the same as before.\nLine 23, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: You mentioned earlier about her job. Was she able to resume work post the crash?\nLine 24, 19:01:39: SJ: She attempted to return to work, but the persistent pain made it unmanageable, particularly the\nLine 25, 19:01:39: long-standing hours. Eventually, she was forced to leave her job.\nLine 26, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: How has this situation impacted your family\u2019s finances?\nLine 27, 19:01:39: SJ: The impact has been substantial. She held the position of an assistant manager at a hair salon,\nLine 28, 19:01:39: bringing in a significant income. Now, with my single income, managing expenses for our four children\nLine 29, 19:01:39: and her medical bills has been strenuous.\nLine 30, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Besides the financial struggle, can you share how your relationship with your wife has\nLine 31, 19:01:39: evolved post the accident?\nLine 32, 19:01:39: SJ: Our relationship has undeniably been affected. She isn\u2019t the same person she was before the crash.\nLine 33, 19:01:39: Her constant pain and fatigue, coupled with frustration, have been hard on both of us.\nLine 34, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: And your children? How have they been coping with all these changes?\n--- End of Page 14 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 15 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: SJ: Our children have had to make significant adjustments. They miss the mother they had before the\nLine 2, 19:01:39: crash, not understanding why she can\u2019t engage in the activities she used to do with them. My older\nLine 3, 19:01:39: sons, in particular, have had to step up, assisting more with household chores. It\u2019s been a lot for them\nLine 4, 19:01:39: too.\nLine 5, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Finally, could you share your hopes for your wife\u2019s future?\nLine 6, 19:01:39: SJ: My biggest hope is for her to find relief from her pain and regain some semblance of normalcy. She\nLine 7, 19:01:39: deserves to live her life, not just endure it. It\u2019s challenging to see such a wonderful person go through\nLine 8, 19:01:39: this. We are taking each day as it comes, hoping for a better future.\nLine 9, 19:01:39: Defense Attorney Cross Examination of Victim\u2019s Husband\nLine 10, 19:01:39: Q: Regarding the foot stretching exercises, you assist her with those?\nLine 11, 19:01:39: A: Yes, I do.\nLine 12, 19:01:39: Q: Looking through her medical records, I noticed there\u2019s mention of an exercise bike at home. Do you\nLine 13, 19:01:39: have one?\nLine 14, 19:01:39: A: Indeed, we do have an exercise bike at home.\nLine 15, 19:01:39: Q: Did she frequently use the exercise bike, especially post-accident?\nLine 16, 19:01:39: A: Initially, during her therapy, they had her try riding the exercise bike.\nLine 17, 19:01:39: Q: Can you tell us what kind of exercises she did at home after the accident?\nLine 18, 19:01:39: A: She was given a chart with exercises, and I\u2019ve been helping her to flex her foot in both directions to\nLine 19, 19:01:39: try and loosen it up.\nLine 20, 19:01:39: Q: How long did this routine last?\nLine 21, 19:01:39: A: Actually, I still assist her with the foot exercises every night.\nLine 22, 19:01:39: Q: So you assist her based on the instructions from the chart?\nLine 23, 19:01:39: A: Not directly from the chart, but I\u2019ve learned the correct angles and try to flex her foot every night for\nLine 24, 19:01:39: her comfort and to aid her sleep.\nLine 25, 19:01:39: Q: Does she drive?\nLine 26, 19:01:39: A: Yes, she does.\nLine 27, 19:01:39: Q: Prior to the accident, she was employed full time?\nLine 28, 19:01:39: A: Yes, that\u2019s correct.\nLine 29, 19:01:39: Q: The jury was informed initially that she was also pursuing a degree?\nLine 30, 19:01:39: A: Yes, she was attending the University of Maryland.\nLine 31, 19:01:39: Q: Did she commute to the university?\nLine 32, 19:01:39: A: At certain points she did, but due to our four children, she primarily takes her classes online now.\n--- End of Page 15 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 16 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: Q: How close is she to obtaining her degree?\nLine 2, 19:01:39: A: She\u2019s expected to graduate within the next year.\nLine 3, 19:01:39: Court: Any redirect?\nLine 4, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: No further questions, Your Honor.\nLine 5, 19:01:39: Court: Thank you, sir, you may step down.

I saw a car traveling westbound on Main Street, which I believe was a blue sedan, run\nLine 14, 19:01:36: the red light and collide with a car traveling northbound on Maple Avenue, which I believe was a white\nLine 15, 19:01:36: SUV.\nLine 16, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: Can you describe the collision in more detail?\nLine 17, 19:01:36: Witness: The blue sedan seemed to be traveling at a high speed and didn't slow down or attempt to stop\nLine 18, 19:01:36: at the red light. It hit the white SUV directly on the driver's side. The impact was quite forceful, and both\nLine 19, 19:01:36: cars spun around significantly.\nLine 20, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: Ms. Miller, you mentioned the blue sedan was traveling at a high speed. How fast would you\nLine 21, 19:01:36: say it was going?\nLine 22, 19:01:36: Witness: It's difficult to say for sure, but it appeared to be going much faster than the posted speed\nLine 23, 19:01:36: limit, which is 35 miles per hour.\nLine 24, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: Did you see the driver of either vehicle at any point?\nLine 25, 19:01:36: Witness: No, I didn't.\nLine 26, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: Ms. Miller, did you notice anything unusual about the driver's behavior in the blue sedan\nLine 27, 19:01:36: before the accident?\nLine 28, 19:01:36: Witness: It's hard to say. Everything happened very quickly, but the car did seem to be swerving slightly\nLine 29, 19:01:36: just before the collision.\nLine 30, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: Ms. Miller, did you call the police or offer assistance to anyone involved in the accident?\nLine 31, 19:01:36: Witness: Yes, I immediately called 911 and stayed at the scene until the police arrived.\nLine 32, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: Did you speak to anyone else who may have witnessed the accident?\n--- End of Page 1 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 2 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:36: Witness: Yes, I exchanged information with another driver who was stopped next to me on Maple\nLine 2, 19:01:36: Avenue at the time.\nLine 3, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: Do you recall the make and model of the other vehicle that you spoke to?\nLine 4, 19:01:36: Witness: I believe it was a silver Toyota Camry, but I'm not entirely sure.\nLine 5, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: That's all my questions at this time.\nLine 6, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: I have no further questions\nLine 7, 19:01:36: Summary:\nLine 8, 19:01:36: The excerpt is from a legal deposition of Michael Anderson, who is under oath to tell the truth. Mr.\nLine 9, 19:01:36: Anderson confirms his employment at Acme Corporation as a graphic designer and details his job duties.\nLine 10, 19:01:36: He also confirms receiving positive performance reviews and never facing disciplinary actions. The\nLine 11, 19:01:36: excerpt ends with a question about witnessing or experiencing any discriminatory situations at Acme.\n--- End of Page 2 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 3 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:36: Deposition:\nLine 2, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Objection, that question calls for legal conclusions from the witness.\nLine 3, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: Withdrawn. Mr. Anderson, please describe any specific incidents or instances at Acme\nLine 4, 19:01:36: that involved your [protected category].\nLine 5, 19:01:36: Witness: There were several things that made me feel uncomfortable. During meetings, colleagues often\nLine 6, 19:01:36: talked over me or dismissed my ideas, particularly when compared to my younger male colleagues. I\nLine 7, 19:01:36: was also consistently passed over for promotions despite having experience and qualifications\nLine 8, 19:01:36: comparable to others who got promoted.\nLine 9, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you be specific about which colleagues treated you this way and provide\nLine 10, 19:01:36: specific examples of situations where these incidents occurred?\nLine 11, 19:01:36: Witness: One specific example would be the marketing campaign for the new product launch in 2023. I\nLine 12, 19:01:36: put significant effort into developing design concepts, but they were ultimately disregarded without any\nLine 13, 19:01:36: explanation. My male colleague's design, which was very similar to mine, was ultimately chosen.\nLine 14, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: Did you ever report any of these incidents to your supervisor or anyone else at Acme?\nLine 15, 19:01:36: Witness: I once mentioned feeling undervalued to my supervisor, but they brushed it off, suggesting I\nLine 16, 19:01:36: needed to \"work harder to prove myself.\" I wasn't comfortable bringing it up further after that.\nLine 17, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: Did you decide to leave Acme voluntarily, or were you terminated?\nLine 18, 19:01:36: Witness: When they announced another promotion I felt qualified for, but was once again passed over\nLine 19, 19:01:36: without explanation, I decided it was time to find a new position where I felt valued and respected.\nLine 20, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you confirm that your decision to leave Acme was solely based on not\nLine 21, 19:01:36: receiving the promotion, and not due to other factors like job performance or personal reasons?\nLine 22, 19:01:36: Witness: To the best of my knowledge, yes. It became clear to me that further advancement\nLine 23, 19:01:36: opportunities within the company were unlikely.\nLine 24, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: That's all my questions at this time.\nLine 25, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, during your time at Acme, did you ever receive any negative performance\nLine 26, 19:01:36: reviews or warnings related to your work performance?\nLine 27, 19:01:36: Witness: No, as mentioned before, my performance reviews were always positive.\nLine 28, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Did you ever attend any diversity and inclusion training offered by Acme during your\nLine 29, 19:01:36: employment?\nLine 30, 19:01:36: Witness: I did participate in the mandatory online training modules, but there weren't any specific\nLine 31, 19:01:36: training sessions related to addressing or reporting potentially discriminatory situations within the\nLine 32, 19:01:36: company.\nLine 33, 19:01:36: Summary\n--- End of Page 3 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 4 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:36: Michael Anderson details specific incidents supporting his feeling of being undervalued based on his\nLine 2, 19:01:36: protected category. He describes colleagues disregarding his ideas and being passed over for\nLine 3, 19:01:36: promotions despite comparable qualifications. He provides a specific example from the 2023 product\nLine 4, 19:01:36: launch where his design was overlooked in favor of a male colleague's similar work. He mentions\nLine 5, 19:01:36: mentioning his concerns to his supervisor but being discouraged from pursuing them. He clarifies his\nLine 6, 19:01:36: decision to leave Acme was due to the lack of advancement opportunities, not performance or personal\nLine 7, 19:01:36: reasons. Ms. Garcia then establishes that Mr. Anderson's performance was consistently good and that\nLine 8, 19:01:36: he participated in available diversity training while at Acme, though specific training for addressing\nLine 9, 19:01:36: potential discrimination was absent.\nLine 10, 19:01:36: Deposition:\nLine 11, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, are you aware of Acme's anti-discrimination policy or how complaints of\nLine 12, 19:01:36: discrimination are addressed within the company?\nLine 13, 19:01:36: Witness: I reviewed the employee handbook, which did explain the existence of an anti-discrimination\nLine 14, 19:01:36: policy. However, I was unsure of the specific complaint process at the time\nLine 15, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you elaborate on why you felt apprehensive about bringing up these\nLine 16, 19:01:36: incidents to your supervisor despite feeling uncomfortable and undervalued?\nLine 17, 19:01:36: Witness: Honestly, there were a few reasons. Firstly, as I mentioned, when I did hint at feeling\nLine 18, 19:01:36: undervalued to my supervisor, their dismissive response discouraged me from further discussions. It\nLine 19, 19:01:36: seemed like they weren't receptive to hearing about any potential issues.\nLine 20, 19:01:36: Secondly, there was a general company culture that made me hesitant to speak up. Younger male\nLine 21, 19:01:36: colleagues often dominated conversations and presentations, and there weren't many women in senior\nLine 22, 19:01:36: positions within the marketing department. It felt like my voice wouldn't be heard or even worse, that\nLine 23, 19:01:36: bringing forward complaints might lead to retaliation or hinder my career further.\nLine 24, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Did you notice any specific instances of retaliation against other employees who may have\nLine 25, 19:01:36: raised complaints or concerns about work environment issues?\nLine 26, 19:01:36: Witness: While I can't say for sure, there was one colleague, Sarah Lopez, who openly challenged gender\nLine 27, 19:01:36: bias during a department meeting but was subsequently given less desirable project assignments\nLine 28, 19:01:36: compared to her male colleagues. This incident definitely reinforced my concerns about potentially\nLine 29, 19:01:36: facing a similar situation.**\nLine 30, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: Objection, speculation about an unrelated case is irrelevant to the present matter.\nLine 31, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Withdrawn. Mr. Anderson, did you ever discuss your concerns about potential bias or lack of\nLine 32, 19:01:36: promotion opportunities with any human resources personnel at Acme?\nLine 33, 19:01:36: Witness: No, I didn't. As I mentioned before, the lack of clarity on the specific complaint process\nLine 34, 19:01:36: combined with the overall culture discouraged me from pursuing that route.\nLine 35, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, since leaving Acme, have you sought employment elsewhere?\n--- End of Page 4 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 5 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, I am currently employed at a different company and feel much more valued and respected\nLine 2, 19:01:37: in my current role. The work environment is significantly more inclusive, and I regularly receive positive\nLine 3, 19:01:37: feedback and opportunities for professional development.\nLine 4, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, how has your experience at Acme impacted you personally and\nLine 5, 19:01:37: professionally?\nLine 6, 19:01:37: Witness: It was definitely a frustrating and discouraging experience. It felt like my hard work and\nLine 7, 19:01:37: qualifications weren't being recognized fairly, leading to some self-doubt and a sense of being\nLine 8, 19:01:37: undervalued. However, finding a new and positive work environment has helped me rebuild my\nLine 9, 19:01:37: confidence and refocus on my career goals.\nLine 10, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: I have no further questions.\nLine 11, 19:01:37: Summary\nLine 12, 19:01:37: This segment explores Mr. Anderson's reasons for not formally complaining despite feeling undervalued.\nLine 13, 19:01:37: He reiterates his supervisor's dismissive response and the perceived lack of receptiveness within the\nLine 14, 19:01:37: company culture. He describes a specific instance where a colleague who challenged gender bias faced\nLine 15, 19:01:37: negative consequences, reinforcing his fear of retaliation. He clarifies that he didn't pursue HR due to\nLine 16, 19:01:37: unclear procedures and the discouraging company culture. Finally, he highlights his positive experience\nLine 17, 19:01:37: at a new company, emphasizing feelings of value, inclusion, and professional growth in contrast to his\nLine 18, 19:01:37: experience at Acme. He concludes by acknowledging the frustration and self-doubt from Acme but also\nLine 19, 19:01:37: the positive impact of finding a supportive work environment.\nLine 20, 19:01:37: Deposition\nLine 21, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: I have one final question. Mr. Anderson, is there anything else you would like to add\nLine 22, 19:01:37: regarding your experience at Acme Corporation?\nLine 23, 19:01:37: Witness: Just that I hope by sharing my story, it can contribute to fostering a more diverse and inclusive\nLine 24, 19:01:37: work environment at Acme for future employees. Everyone deserves to feel valued and respected in\nLine 25, 19:01:37: their workplace, regardless of their [protected category].\nLine 26, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Interesting point, Mr. Anderson. Ms. Garcia, while you have no further questions, I'd like\nLine 27, 19:01:37: to explore some aspects of Mr. Anderson's experience further before concluding the deposition.\nLine 28, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: No objection. Please proceed, Mr. Thompson.\nLine 29, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, you mentioned feeling unsure about the specific complaint process at\nLine 30, 19:01:37: Acme. Did you take any steps to learn more about it after your meeting with your supervisor?\nLine 31, 19:01:37: Witness: No, I didn't feel comfortable approaching my supervisor again after their dismissive response.\nLine 32, 19:01:37: Additionally, I recall the employee handbook being quite lengthy, and finding specific information about\nLine 33, 19:01:37: the complaint process proved difficult at the time.\n--- End of Page 5 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 6 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: You mentioned a colleague, Sarah Lopez, who voiced concerns about gender bias. Did\nLine 2, 19:01:37: you ever speak to her directly about her experience and the alleged retaliation she faced?\nLine 3, 19:01:37: Witness: Briefly, yes. We expressed our mutual frustrations and the feeling of being undervalued within\nLine 4, 19:01:37: the department. However, we were both hesitant to pursue any formal complaints due to the\nLine 5, 19:01:37: aforementioned concerns about the company culture and potential retaliation.\nLine 6, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Did you ever discuss the issue of lack of promotion opportunities with any other\nLine 7, 19:01:37: colleagues, particularly women in the marketing department?\nLine 8, 19:01:37: Witness: Not directly. While there were a few women colleagues in the department, none of them were\nLine 9, 19:01:37: in senior positions. The general environment discouraged open communication about potentially\nLine 10, 19:01:37: sensitive topics like discrimination.\nLine 11, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Thompson, I object to leading the witness. Can you rephrase your question and allow\nLine 12, 19:01:37: Mr. Anderson to answer in his own words?\nLine 13, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Apologies, Ms. Garcia. Mr. Anderson, to clarify, did you have any informal conversations\nLine 14, 19:01:37: with other colleagues about your concerns regarding promotion opportunities or potential gender bias\nLine 15, 19:01:37: within the marketing department at Acme?\nLine 16, 19:01:37: Witness: There weren't any specific discussions about promotions or bias, but the general atmosphere\nLine 17, 19:01:37: around the lack of female representation in senior positions was a frequent topic of quiet observation\nLine 18, 19:01:37: amongst some female colleagues. We felt implicit pressure to work harder and prove ourselves more\nLine 19, 19:01:37: than our male colleagues, but reaching leadership positions seemed like an increasingly distant\nLine 20, 19:01:37: prospect.\nLine 21, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you elaborate on what kind of \"pressure\" you felt, and was there any\nLine 22, 19:01:37: specific instance or behavior from colleagues or superiors that made you feel this way?\nLine 23, 19:01:37: Summary\nLine 24, 19:01:37: In the concluding segment, Mr. Anderson expresses hope that his experience can contribute to a more\nLine 25, 19:01:37: inclusive work environment at Acme. Mr. Thompson then delves deeper into specific aspects of Mr.\nLine 26, 19:01:37: Anderson's experience:\nLine 27, 19:01:37: Complaint process: Mr. Anderson cites discomfort following his supervisor's reaction and difficulty\nLine 28, 19:01:37: navigating the lengthy employee handbook as reasons for not seeking further information.\nLine 29, 19:01:37: Colleague's experience: He mentions briefly discussing his frustrations and concerns with Sarah Lopez\nLine 30, 19:01:37: but clarifies their shared hesitation to pursue formal complaints due to company culture concerns.\nLine 31, 19:01:37: Promotion opportunities and gender bias: He explains the lack of open communication about these\nLine 32, 19:01:37: issues and feeling unspoken pressure due to the absence of women in senior positions, though no\nLine 33, 19:01:37: specific discussions on bias occurred.\nLine 34, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia objects to a leading question about bias, and Mr. Thompson rephrases, allowing Mr.\nLine 35, 19:01:37: Anderson to clarify further. He explains the silent observation among female colleagues of the lack of\n--- End of Page 6 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 7 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:37: female leadership and the perceived need to overachieve compared to male colleagues. Ms. Garcia\nLine 2, 19:01:37: requests further details about the pressure felt by Mr. Anderson.\nLine 3, 19:01:37: Deposition\nLine 4, 19:01:37: Witness: It wasn't any direct confrontation or statement, but more of a subtle feeling arising from\nLine 5, 19:01:37: observing the lack of female representation in leadership roles combined with certain comments about\nLine 6, 19:01:37: needing to \"work harder\" or \"prove myself\" despite my consistent positive performance reviews.\nLine 7, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Thank you, Mr. Anderson. These are valuable insights. Do you have any further\nLine 8, 19:01:37: questions, Ms. Garcia?\nLine 9, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: (after reviewing her notes) I have a few follow-up questions for clarification. However, due\nLine 10, 19:01:37: to the time constraints, I would like to schedule a follow-up session at your earliest convenience, Mr.\nLine 11, 19:01:37: Thompson, to continue exploring specific details and potential evidence.\nLine 12, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: No objection. Mr. Anderson, are you available for a follow-up session within the next\nLine 13, 19:01:37: week?\nLine 14, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, I am available. Please let me know the details when you've scheduled it\nLine 15, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, since our last session, have you had any time to review Acme\nLine 16, 19:01:37: Corporation's employee handbook pertaining to the complaint process for potential discrimination?\nLine 17, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, I have.\nLine 18, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Can you briefly describe the steps outlined in the handbook for filing a complaint based\nLine 19, 19:01:37: on potential discrimination?\nLine 20, 19:01:37: Witness: The handbook mentioned employees could submit a written complaint to the Human\nLine 21, 19:01:37: Resources department or verbally report it to an HR representative or any manager. However, specific\nLine 22, 19:01:37: details about the investigation process or resolution options were quite vague.\nLine 23, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, did the employee handbook specify who constitutes a \"manager\" authorized\nLine 24, 19:01:37: to receive such initial verbal complaints?\nLine 25, 19:01:37: Witness: No, it didn't provide any specific details about which managers were included in that definition\nLine 26, 19:01:37: or if all managers were authorized to receive such reports.\nLine 27, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, you previously mentioned frustration with receiving similar design\nLine 28, 19:01:37: concepts to yours being chosen over your own work while working at Acme. Do you still have copies of\nLine 29, 19:01:37: these original design concepts and the final versions ultimately used?\nLine 30, 19:01:37: Witness: Unfortunately, I didn't retain individual copies of every design iteration. However, I did\nLine 31, 19:01:37: maintain some preliminary sketches and digital drafts from several projects, including the one discussed\nLine 32, 19:01:37: earlier related to the 2023 product launch campaign.\nLine 33, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Would you be willing to provide these materials as potential evidence in this case?\nLine 34, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, I can bring them to the next session.\n--- End of Page 7 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 8 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, are you aware of other colleagues who may have retained copies of their\nLine 2, 19:01:37: rejected design projects or drafts during their employment at Acme?\nLine 3, 19:01:37: Witness: I'm not certain, but I remember several colleagues raising concerns about the inconsistent\nLine 4, 19:01:37: feedback and selection process for design concepts. It's possible some of them might have kept records\nLine 5, 19:01:37: for their own reference.\nLine 6, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: We will look into that possibility. Mr. Anderson, during your time at Acme, did you ever\nLine 7, 19:01:37: meet or hear about any employees who filed official complaints based on experiencing discrimination?\nLine 8, 19:01:37: Witness: Not officially. As mentioned earlier, there was an underlying lack of transparency and open\nLine 9, 19:01:37: communication around potentially sensitive topics like discrimination. Therefore, it was difficult to know\nLine 10, 19:01:37: for sure.\nLine 11, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, did you receive any additional training or workshops related to diversity and\nLine 12, 19:01:37: inclusion since leaving Acme Corporation?\nLine 13, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, my current employer offers comprehensive training programs and workshops regarding\nLine 14, 19:01:37: diversity and inclusion as part of their ongoing commitment to a fair and equitable work environment.\nLine 15, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Do you find these additional training programs and the overall work environment at\nLine 16, 19:01:37: your current company to be beneficial compared to your experience at Acme?\nLine 17, 19:01:37: Witness: Absolutely. The focus on creating a safe space for open communication, valuing diverse\nLine 18, 19:01:37: perspectives, and providing equal opportunities for growth has been incredibly positive and\nLine 19, 19:01:37: empowering.\nLine 20, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: No further questions at this time.\nLine 21, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, as mentioned previously, we would like you to bring copies of the design\nLine 22, 19:01:37: materials you retained for the next session. Additionally, I may reach out to inquire about potential\nLine 23, 19:01:37: colleagues who might have kept similar records. Is that alright?\nLine 24, 19:01:37: Witness: That's perfectly fine. Please let me know if you need anything else in the meantime.\nLine 25, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, one final question before we adjourn. You mentioned feeling hesitant to\nLine 26, 19:01:37: bring up your concerns to your supervisor after their dismissive response. Did their reaction specifically\nLine 27, 19:01:37: mention any consequences of raising the potential bias issue?\nLine 28, 19:01:37: Witness: Not directly. There wasn't an explicit threat of any sort. However, their dismissive tone and the\nLine 29, 19:01:37: implication that my concerns weren't valid created an atmosphere where I felt further discussion would\nLine 30, 19:01:37: be futile and potentially disadvantageous.\nLine 31, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Objection, speculation about the witness's interpretation of a supervisor's tone is not based\nLine 32, 19:01:37: on facts.\nLine 33, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Reframing, Mr. Anderson. How did your supervisor's response make you feel about the\nLine 34, 19:01:37: potential consequences of reporting your concerns?\n--- End of Page 8 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 9 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:38: Witness: Their response discouraged me and made me feel unheard. It conveyed the impression that my\nLine 2, 19:01:38: concerns about potential bias wouldn't be taken seriously and could potentially hinder my career\nLine 3, 19:01:38: progression within the company.\nLine 4, 19:01:38: Summary\nLine 5, 19:01:38: The concluding segment addresses further details and sets the stage for a follow-up session:\nLine 6, 19:01:38: Complaint process: Mr. Anderson reviews the handbook and describes the outlined steps for filing a\nLine 7, 19:01:38: complaint, noting the vagueness regarding investigation and resolution. Ms. Garcia highlights the lack of\nLine 8, 19:01:38: clarity on who qualifies as a \"manager\" authorized to receive initial verbal reports.\nLine 9, 19:01:38: Design concepts: Mr. Anderson clarifies he still possesses some preliminary sketches and drafts,\nLine 10, 19:01:38: including those from the 2023 product launch, and agrees to provide them as potential evidence. Mr.\nLine 11, 19:01:38: Thompson expresses interest in exploring the possibility of other colleagues retaining similar materials.\nLine 12, 19:01:38: Official complaints: Mr. Anderson reiterates the lack of knowledge about any official discrimination\nLine 13, 19:01:38: complaints at Acme due to the previously mentioned culture of secrecy.\nLine 14, 19:01:38: Current company: Mr. Anderson confirms receiving additional diversity and inclusion training at his\nLine 15, 19:01:38: current company. He emphasizes the positive aspects of his new work environment, highlighting open\nLine 16, 19:01:38: communication, valuing diverse perspectives, and equal opportunities, contrasting it with his experience\nLine 17, 19:01:38: at Acme.\nLine 18, 19:01:38: Follow-up: Both parties agree to a follow-up session. Mr. Thompson clarifies his intention to request the\nLine 19, 19:01:38: design materials and potentially contact other colleagues. Ms. Garcia objects to the witness's\nLine 20, 19:01:38: interpretation of his supervisor's tone, leading Mr. Thompson to rephrase the question, to which Mr.\nLine 21, 19:01:38: Anderson reiterates feeling discouraged and unheard, fearing his concerns wouldn't be taken seriously\nLine 22, 19:01:38: and could hinder his career.\nLine 23, 19:01:38: Deposition\nLine 24, 19:01:38: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Thompson, I believe we've covered the essential topics for today. However, as these are\nLine 25, 19:01:38: complex claims, I would appreciate the opportunity to review the transcript and potentially ask further\nLine 26, 19:01:38: questions at a future session, should any need arise.\nLine 27, 19:01:38: Mr. Thompson: No objection. Mr. Anderson, as Ms. Garcia mentioned, we appreciate your willingness to\nLine 28, 19:01:38: cooperate and provide additional materials. We will be in touch to schedule a follow-up session if\nLine 29, 19:01:38: needed.\nLine 30, 19:01:38: Witness: Understood.\nLine 31, 19:01:38: Summary\nLine 32, 19:01:38: The deposition concludes with Ms. Garcia expressing a desire to review the transcript and potentially\nLine 33, 19:01:38: ask further questions in a future session if needed. Mr. Thompson agrees, and both thank Mr. Anderson\nLine 34, 19:01:38: for his cooperation and willingness to provide additional materials. Mr. Anderson acknowledges their\nLine 35, 19:01:38: communication and awaits further information regarding a potential follow-up session.\n--- End of Page 9 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 10 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:38: Deposition\nLine 2, 19:01:38: MILLER: A driver is obligated to pay attention to the road and yield to other drivers when required. Let\nLine 3, 19:01:38: me take you back to what happened on April 20th, 2022. The Defendant, who was an attorney for the\nLine 4, 19:01:38: IRS, was driving her usual route to work. She drove down Annapolis Road to take a left onto another\nLine 5, 19:01:38: road.\nLine 6, 19:01:38: (Could we have the next slide, please?) She was driving down this road\u2026 can everyone see this? She\nLine 7, 19:01:38: stopped at a light on a clear day. While stopped, she reached down to find her parking pass.\nLine 8, 19:01:38: DEFENSE LAWYER: May we approach?\nLine 9, 19:01:38: THE COURT: Yes.\nLine 10, 19:01:38: BENCH CONFERENCE\nLine 11, 19:01:38: (Bench Conference begins \u2013 10:26:39m.)\nLine 12, 19:01:38: (The parties approach the bench for a discussion.)\nLine 13, 19:01:38: THE COURT: By court ruling, liability has been established. The focus of this case is only on damages. I\nLine 14, 19:01:38: understand why we\u2019re discussing these details, but it\u2019s about damages.\nLine 15, 19:01:38: MILLER: I\u2019m setting the scene for the accident because her damages are part of the accident narrative.\nLine 16, 19:01:38: DEFENSE LAWYER: We\u2019re only discussing the fact that an accident happened and a person was injured.\nLine 17, 19:01:38: The details about reaching and negligence seem to be evidence of liability.\nLine 18, 19:01:38: THE COURT: I understand. It\u2019s your opening statement, so I\u2019ll give you some leeway.\nLine 19, 19:01:38: MILLER: I\u2019m just providing context. I\u2019ll be getting into the damages soon.\nLine 20, 19:01:38: THE COURT: Alright.\nLine 21, 19:01:38: (Bench Conference concluded \u2013 10:27:32 m.)\nLine 22, 19:01:38: (The parties return to their places.)\nLine 23, 19:01:38: MILLER: The Defendant heard a horn beep and took a left turn. She didn\u2019t see the Plaintiff, who had the\nLine 24, 19:01:38: right of way, coming from the opposite direction. Due to the collision, the Plaintiff\u2019s ankle was broken\nLine 25, 19:01:38: and required surgery.\nLine 26, 19:01:38: Take a look at these images. The first one shows her ankle before surgery, the second one after surgery.\nLine 27, 19:01:38: Today, she still has 15 screws and three plates in her ankle. She will never be able to run again and\nLine 28, 19:01:38: standing for extended periods of time is difficult.\nLine 29, 19:01:38: We\u2019ve brought this case before you because of the harm caused to the Plaintiff. We needed to agree\nLine 30, 19:01:38: that the Defendant was at fault for the accident, which she has accepted. We also had to understand the\nLine 31, 19:01:38: extent and implications of the Plaintiff\u2019s damages, not just the initial injury and surgery, but also its long-\nLine 32, 19:01:38: term impact on her life.\nLine 33, 19:01:38: To do this, we spoke to her doctors, her husband, her friends, and even her employer. One of her\nLine 34, 19:01:38: doctors is going to talk to you.\n--- End of Page 10 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 11 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:38: This is the guy to see if something awful like this is going to happen to your ankle. He received an Ivy\nLine 2, 19:01:38: League education and, at one point, was the chief of foot and ankle orthopedic injuries at Johns\nLine 3, 19:01:38: Hopkins. He consults for the Baltimore Orioles. His resume, I want to say, is as long as your arm, but it\u2019s\nLine 4, 19:01:38: actually a lot longer than that.\nLine 5, 19:01:38: We\u2019re going to bring him to talk to you guys, in a very 2023 way. It\u2019s going to be by videotape, so his\nLine 6, 19:01:38: testimony will be by videotape, but it holds the same force as if it was at trial, and he came here to see\nLine 7, 19:01:38: us. And, of course, my partner Laura Zois and the defense attorney had an opportunity to ask him\nLine 8, 19:01:38: questions.\nLine 9, 19:01:38: He\u2019s going to tell you she still has 15 screws and three plates in her ankle holding everything together.\nLine 10, 19:01:38: The problem with that is that it creates a breeding ground for arthritis, and this 33-year-old woman\nLine 11, 19:01:38: already has the signs of arthritis. At some point, she\u2019s going to need what\u2019s called a fusion, which will\nLine 12, 19:01:38: stabilize her ankle. The bad news is, you can\u2019t move it once it locks, so you no longer have the ability to\nLine 13, 19:01:38: bend.\nLine 14, 19:01:38: This trial is about the harms and losses that she has suffered and endured as the result of this accident.\nLine 15, 19:01:38: This is not a case about sympathy. You should not award her damages because you feel sorry for her.\nLine 16, 19:01:38: You\u2019re going to hear about how the accident has impacted her professional and personal life.\nLine 17, 19:01:38: At the time of the crash, they were a very young family. They were an energetic family. This is an active\nLine 18, 19:01:38: family with four kids doing everything you can imagine, Six Flags, the park. They would run together.\nLine 19, 19:01:38: They played basketball together. They traveled everywhere, New York, Baltimore, Washington, DC. They\nLine 20, 19:01:38: were just a very active family.\nLine 21, 19:01:38: And she also had a vibrant social life. She was a hairstylist, and she loved that job. It was her social outlet\nLine 22, 19:01:38: beside her kids. She would do the church choir every Wednesday, and still found times to go out and see\nLine 23, 19:01:38: her family. She\u2019s still fighting with her family, but it\u2019s hard.\nLine 24, 19:01:38: She can\u2019t work as a hairstylist anymore. So what did she do? She went back to school to the University\nLine 25, 19:01:38: of Maryland. She\u2019s working, getting very close to getting her degree. She\u2019s still fighting. She has four kids\nLine 26, 19:01:38: they\u2019re chasing around.\nLine 27, 19:01:38: Let\u2019s go back and talk about how it ended up. Let\u2019s talk about the accident. She had this awful crash and\nLine 28, 19:01:38: needed emergency surgery where they put in these screws. She had a nine-month-old baby, along with\nLine 29, 19:01:38: three other kids. She and the two girls, the younger ones, went to live with her mom. Her mom took\nLine 30, 19:01:38: care of her and the girls, while her husband took care of the other kids.\nLine 31, 19:01:38: This has been a massive disruption to their lives. The accident has completely changed her life, and it\u2019s\nLine 32, 19:01:38: reflected in every facet of her day-to-day. Her job, her family life, her hobbies, everything she used to\nLine 33, 19:01:38: take pleasure in has been impacted in one way or another. And the evidence in this case will show these\nLine 34, 19:01:38: changes are likely to persist for the rest of her life.\nLine 35, 19:01:38: We ask you to consider the totality of these changes, the persistent harm and loss she\u2019s suffered and\nLine 36, 19:01:38: will continue to suffer, as a direct result of the accident. We ask you to consider these when coming to a\nLine 37, 19:01:38: decision in this case.\n--- End of Page 11 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 12 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:38: This accident, however, led to an upheaval in their lives. About a month after the accident, she managed\nLine 2, 19:01:38: to return home with the kids. Her mother, an FDA employee, took three months off work to care for her,\nLine 3, 19:01:38: her daughter, and her grandchildren. The accident wreaked havoc on their lives.\nLine 4, 19:01:38: She endured six months of rigorous physical therapy and another operation. While it was painful and\nLine 5, 19:01:38: difficult, the effort was worthwhile as it improved her condition, especially her ankle, though we wish\nLine 6, 19:01:38: she had recovered more.\nLine 7, 19:01:38: As we delve into this case, it\u2019s about the harm and losses experienced. We will ask you to make amends\nLine 8, 19:01:38: where possible and provide compensation for the irreparable harm. The damages can be categorized\nLine 9, 19:01:38: into three parts: her medical bills, the post-accident trauma suffered by her and her family, and the pain\nLine 10, 19:01:38: she will endure for the expected next 45 years of her life.\nLine 11, 19:01:38: She was a spontaneous person, fond of making impromptu plans like going to Virginia Beach over the\nLine 12, 19:01:38: weekend or heading to the park. Now, every activity revolves around her ability to reach there, her\nLine 13, 19:01:38: mobility, and whether she can tolerate the pain during the trip. This situation has affected her and her\nLine 14, 19:01:38: four kids, as well as her husband.\nLine 15, 19:01:38: The court wants to clarify that the evidence and testimonies from the witness stand are what will\nLine 16, 19:01:38: control your deliberations. Opening statements and closing arguments of lawyers do not constitute\nLine 17, 19:01:38: evidence.\nLine 18, 19:01:38: This case is not just about the suffering of their children or her husband. It\u2019s about the impact of their\nLine 19, 19:01:38: suffering on her. We will ask you to consider an amount that may seem high at the beginning. But we\nLine 20, 19:01:38: believe that after hearing all the evidence, you\u2019ll find it to be a fair compensation for her losses and\nLine 21, 19:01:38: harm. The amount we suggest is $1.1 million.\nLine 22, 19:01:38: Defense Opening Statement\nLine 23, 19:01:38: Regarding the defendant, they acknowledge the responsibility for the accident and that it was their\nLine 24, 19:01:38: fault. The case is for you to determine the appropriate damages. The injury is severe, and they ask for an\nLine 25, 19:01:38: extraordinary amount of compensation.\nLine 26, 19:01:38: She broke her ankle, which was repaired surgically with plates and screws. There was a second surgery\nLine 27, 19:01:38: due to loosening of the screws, which were then removed. She attended physical therapy, which\nLine 28, 19:01:38: improved her ability to move her ankle. Whether she will need surgery in the future is uncertain.\nLine 29, 19:01:38: The past medical expenses are around $36,505, which we don\u2019t contest. Her lost wages due to the\nLine 30, 19:01:38: accident are around $3,400 to $3,500. These are not the focal points of this case. The main issue is the\nLine 31, 19:01:38: amount to be awarded for non-economic damages, for which we request something fair, reasonable,\nLine 32, 19:01:38: and sensible.\nLine 33, 19:01:38: Thank you for your time and attention, and we hope to conclude this case promptly.\nLine 34, 19:01:38: Testimony of Victim\u2019s Husband\nLine 35, 19:01:38: Mr. Miller: Good morning. Can I have your address?\nLine 36, 19:01:38: SJ: Certainly.\nLine 37, 19:01:38: Mr. Miller: How long have you lived at that address?\n--- End of Page 12 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 13 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: SJ: I bought the house in 2003, so it\u2019s been approximately ten years.\nLine 2, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Who lives there with you?\nLine 3, 19:01:39: SJ: My wife, and our four children.\nLine 4, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Can you tell the jury how old your children are and their names?\nLine 5, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes. My children are 13, and the others are\u2026\nLine 6, 19:01:39: The Honorable Judge: Please continue.\nLine 7, 19:01:39: SJ: \u2026five, and three.\nLine 8, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: I understand. And for some background, what do you do for a living?\nLine 9, 19:01:39: SJ: I\u2019m currently the general manager at Oreck Clean Home Center.\nLine 10, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: And where are these locations?\nLine 11, 19:01:39: SJ: We have six locations in Maryland and Virginia.\nLine 12, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: What are your responsibilities at work?\nLine 13, 19:01:39: SJ: I oversee all six stores and manage one of them.\nLine 14, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Can you describe your work schedule?\nLine 15, 19:01:39: SJ: I work Monday through Saturday, from 10:00 am to 7:00 pm. Often, I work seven days a week which\nLine 16, 19:01:39: means working on Sundays from 12:00 pm to 5:00 pm.\nLine 17, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: How do you feel about those hours?\nLine 18, 19:01:39: SJ: They are long, but I need to work to support my family.\nLine 19, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: How long have you known your wife?\nLine 20, 19:01:39: SJ: I met her in 1993, she was my sister\u2019s best friend.\nLine 21, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: You mean your wife was your sister\u2019s best friend?\nLine 22, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes, I apologize for the confusion. She was indeed my sister\u2019s best friend.\nLine 23, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Let\u2019s move to another topic. Do you remember the car accident your wife was in 2022?\nLine 24, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes, I do.\nLine 25, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Prior to the accident, can you describe your household?\nLine 26, 19:01:39: SJ: Our household was what I would consider the perfect life. My wife and children were happy and\nLine 27, 19:01:39: always engaged in activities. We used to take vacations and attend family reunions.\nLine 28, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Was your wife a spontaneous person or a planner?\nLine 29, 19:01:39: SJ: She was more spontaneous, always ready to take on new activities.\n--- End of Page 13 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 14 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Could you describe her for the jury?\nLine 2, 19:01:39: SJ: She is always happy, loves socializing and helping people. She attended choir rehearsal, Bible study\nLine 3, 19:01:39: every week, and also took care of our four children.\nLine 4, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: What was her job at the time of the crash?\nLine 5, 19:01:39: SJ: She was the assistant manager of a hair salon.\nLine 6, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Did she enjoy her work?\nLine 7, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes, she loved her work. It was part of her identity.\nLine 8, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Did your wife\u2019s demeanor change after the car accident?\nLine 9, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes, after the accident everything changed. Our family life and activity level changed significantly. She\nLine 10, 19:01:39: used to take the children to sporting events and practice basketball. Now, she can\u2019t do these activities.\nLine 11, 19:01:39: She no longer goes on family vacations. My two older sons call her \u201cboring\u201d now because of her reduced\nLine 12, 19:01:39: activity level. The accident has restricted her capabilities and as a result, she can\u2019t even do simple tasks\nLine 13, 19:01:39: like carrying laundry baskets or standing up to cook. Our family life has changed drastically since the\nLine 14, 19:01:39: accident.\nLine 15, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Has your wife gone back to work since the accident?\nLine 16, 19:01:39: SJ: She tried to help a friend out a couple of months ago at her hair salon, but it ended with her in a lot\nLine 17, 19:01:39: of pain due to the swelling in her ankle.\nLine 18, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: I have here a picture you received from your wife. Is this the picture she sent you?\nLine 19, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Can you tell us how your wife\u2019s personal social life has been affected since the crash?\nLine 20, 19:01:39: SJ: Her social life has indeed changed significantly. Before the accident, she would regularly go out with\nLine 21, 19:01:39: friends, engage in dancing, and other social activities. However, the constant pain and discomfort after\nLine 22, 19:01:39: the crash have made such activities impossible. Her social life is definitely not the same as before.\nLine 23, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: You mentioned earlier about her job. Was she able to resume work post the crash?\nLine 24, 19:01:39: SJ: She attempted to return to work, but the persistent pain made it unmanageable, particularly the\nLine 25, 19:01:39: long-standing hours. Eventually, she was forced to leave her job.\nLine 26, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: How has this situation impacted your family\u2019s finances?\nLine 27, 19:01:39: SJ: The impact has been substantial. She held the position of an assistant manager at a hair salon,\nLine 28, 19:01:39: bringing in a significant income. Now, with my single income, managing expenses for our four children\nLine 29, 19:01:39: and her medical bills has been strenuous.\nLine 30, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Besides the financial struggle, can you share how your relationship with your wife has\nLine 31, 19:01:39: evolved post the accident?\nLine 32, 19:01:39: SJ: Our relationship has undeniably been affected. She isn\u2019t the same person she was before the crash.\nLine 33, 19:01:39: Her constant pain and fatigue, coupled with frustration, have been hard on both of us.\nLine 34, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: And your children? How have they been coping with all these changes?\n--- End of Page 14 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 15 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: SJ: Our children have had to make significant adjustments. They miss the mother they had before the\nLine 2, 19:01:39: crash, not understanding why she can\u2019t engage in the activities she used to do with them. My older\nLine 3, 19:01:39: sons, in particular, have had to step up, assisting more with household chores. It\u2019s been a lot for them\nLine 4, 19:01:39: too.\nLine 5, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Finally, could you share your hopes for your wife\u2019s future?\nLine 6, 19:01:39: SJ: My biggest hope is for her to find relief from her pain and regain some semblance of normalcy.

When you say scarring, you mean the scabs\nLine 18, 18:58:42: from the surgery?\nLine 19, 18:58:42: A. Yeah.

About how often do you get pain?\nLine 8, 18:58:46: A. It depends on activity. I would say probably\nLine 9, 18:58:46: about four or five times a week. It depends how long\nLine 10, 18:58:46: I'm on it.\nLine 11, 18:58:46: Q. Okay. What type of activity causes the pain?\nLine 12, 18:58:46: A. Well, just being on it all day or walking.\nLine 13, 18:58:46: Like if I go to the mall or something, a couple hours\nLine 14, 18:58:46: of driving a stick shift vehicle.\nLine 15, 18:58:46: Q. Do you have a stick shift vehicle?\nLine 16, 18:58:46: A. Not anymore. My wife's -- my girlfriend's\nLine 17, 18:58:46: brother, he has a stick shift vehicie. Sometimes he\nLine 18, 18:58:46: needs to use mine because mine has more space and\nLine 19, 18:58:46: I'll use his to go to work.\nLine 20, 18:58:46: Q.

Anything else that you do\nLine 6, 18:58:46: specifically that causes pain?\nLine 7, 18:58:46: A. I can't think of anything right now.\nLine 8, 18:58:46: Q. Okay. And I think the answers to\nLine 9, 18:58:46: interrogatories mentioned part of your job is\nLine 10, 18:58:46: shoveling?\nLine 11, 18:58:46: A. Yes.\nLine 12, 18:58:46: Q. When you're doing shoveling, does that cause\nLine 13, 18:58:46: problems with your knee either while you're working\nLine 14, 18:58:46: or later?\nLine 15, 18:58:46: A. What I do when I'm shoveling now is\nLine 16, 18:58:46: of using my right leg -- you know, when you\nLine 17, 18:58:46: you've got to kick the shovel in to be able\nLine 18, 18:58:46: the dirt out,\nLine 19, 18:58:46: Q. This is when you're digging like contaminated\nLine 20, 18:58:46: soil or something like that?\nLine 21, 18:58:46: A. Yeah.

I probably\nLine 14, 18:58:50: can, but I don't want to do it because it's just the\nLine 15, 18:58:50: fear of getting hurt again I guess.\nLine 16, 18:58:50: Q.

When you say it was a blink of an eye\nLine 19, 18:58:10: thing --\nLine 20, 18:58:10: A. I saw the lights and we hit.

I think the surgery was in May of 2003, does\nLine 13, 18:58:42: that sound right?\nLine 14, 18:58:42: 10 A. I think so,\nLine 15, 18:58:42: 11 Q. The knee, was it improved at all with the\nLine 16, 18:58:42: therapy or did the therapy just not help?\nLine 17, 18:58:42: 13 A. No, it wasn't doing much. Basically what the\nLine 18, 18:58:42: doctor said, that they were going to do the therapy\nLine 19, 18:58:42: to strengthen the knee for surgery. This way I'd\nLine 20, 18:58:42: have supposedly a quicker recovery.\nLine 21, 18:58:42: Q.

But it was Dr. Shepherd who actually\nLine 7, 18:58:42: sent you to Dr. O'Hearn?\nLine 8, 18:58:42: A. Yeah.\nLine 9, 18:58:42: Q.

They did\nLine 15, 18:58:42: therapy, then like a month later after the scarring\nLine 16, 18:58:42: healed they put me in aquatic therapy.\nLine 17, 18:58:42: Q. When you say scarring, you mean the scabs\nLine 18, 18:58:42: from the surgery?\nLine 19, 18:58:42: A. Yeah. After all that healed up, they put me\nLine 20, 18:58:42: in aquatic therapy which is the pool.\nLine 21, 18:58:42: Q. Right.\nLine 22, 18:58:42: A.

No, there's no slippage, nothing like\nLine 5, 18:58:46: stability wise. I feel okay. But I just -- I get\nLine 6, 18:58:46: pain,\nLine 7, 18:58:46: Q. About how often do you get pain?\nLine 8, 18:58:46: A. It depends on activity. I would say probably\nLine 9, 18:58:46: about four or five times a week. It depends how long\nLine 10, 18:58:46: I'm on it.\nLine 11, 18:58:46: Q. Okay. What type of activity causes the pain?\nLine 12, 18:58:46: A. Well, just being on it all day or walking.\nLine 13, 18:58:46: Like if I go to the mall or something, a couple hours\nLine 14, 18:58:46: of driving a stick shift vehicle.\nLine 15, 18:58:46: Q. Do you have a stick shift vehicle?\nLine 16, 18:58:46: A. Not anymore. My wife's -- my girlfriend's\nLine 17, 18:58:46: brother, he has a stick shift vehicie. Sometimes he\nLine 18, 18:58:46: needs to use mine because mine has more space and\nLine 19, 18:58:46: I'll use his to go to work.\nLine 20, 18:58:46: Q. Well, if you do that, though, you're not\nLine 21, 18:58:46: several hours behind the wheel?\nLine 22, 18:58:46: A. Not several hours, but the clutch and stuff.\nLine 23, 18:58:46: Q.

Anything else that you do\nLine 6, 18:58:46: specifically that causes pain?\nLine 7, 18:58:46: A. I can't think of anything right now.\nLine 8, 18:58:46: Q. Okay. And I think the answers to\nLine 9, 18:58:46: interrogatories mentioned part of your job is\nLine 10, 18:58:46: shoveling?\nLine 11, 18:58:46: A. Yes.\nLine 12, 18:58:46: Q. When you're doing shoveling, does that cause\nLine 13, 18:58:46: problems with your knee either while you're working\nLine 14, 18:58:46: or later?\nLine 15, 18:58:46: A. What I do when I'm shoveling now is\nLine 16, 18:58:46: of using my right leg -- you know, when you\nLine 17, 18:58:46: you've got to kick the shovel in to be able\nLine 18, 18:58:46: the dirt out,\nLine 19, 18:58:46: Q. This is when you're digging like contaminated\nLine 20, 18:58:46: soil or something like that?\nLine 21, 18:58:46: A. Yeah. So what I do is kick with my left\nLine 22, 18:58:46: instead of kicking with my right.\nLine 23, 18:58:46: Q. So you rest on the right and you do the work\nLine 24, 18:58:46: with the left?\nLine 25, 18:58:46: Corbin & Hook Reporting, Inc.\nLine 26, 18:58:46: (410) 268-6006 - 1-866-337-6778\n--- End of Page 66 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 67 ---\nLine 1, 18:58:46: Deposition of Sain\nLine 2, 18:58:46: Taken on July 28, 2004\nLine 3, 18:58:46: Page 67\nLine 4, 18:58:46: A.

Probably out of a month probably\nLine 8, 18:58:46: twice.\nLine 9, 18:58:46: Q. Okay. Obviously that's only on land spiils\nLine 10, 18:58:46: or something like that?\nLine 11, 18:58:46: A. Yeah. We don't have many water spills\nLine 12, 18:58:46: either.\nLine 13, 18:58:46: Q. Right. So you indicated your knee feels okay\nLine 14, 18:58:46: stability wise, but you get pain four or five times a\nLine 15, 18:58:46: week?\nLine 16, 18:58:46: A. Yeah.\nLine 17, 18:58:46: What do you do for the pain?\nLine 18, 18:58:46: Aspercreme or Flexall.\nLine 19, 18:58:46: And those are both over the counter, right?\nLine 20, 18:58:46: A. Yeah.\nLine 21, 18:58:46: Q. Do you do that at night when you get home or\nLine 22, 18:58:46: do you do it on the job? How often do you have to\nLine 23, 18:58:46: apply that?\nLine 24, 18:58:46: A.

Sometimes in the morning I'll wake\nLine 5, 18:58:46: up and I'll have that pain, so I know I have to carry\nLine 6, 18:58:46: it with me.\nLine 7, 18:58:46: Q. Is there anything that your knee condition\nLine 8, 18:58:46: prevents you from doing today that you could do back\nLine 9, 18:58:46: before February of 2003?\nLine 10, 18:58:46: A. Well, I was running around riding a bike and\nLine 11, 18:58:46: stuff. I'm not doing that anymore. I might jump on\nLine 12, 18:58:46: a motorcycle every now and then, but I'm not pedaling\nLine 13, 18:58:46: a bike or anything anymore.\nLine 14, 18:58:46: Q.

Not that I can't do it, just I don't want to\nLine 13, 18:58:50: do anything that might aggravate my knee. I probably\nLine 14, 18:58:50: can, but I don't want to do it because it's just the\nLine 15, 18:58:50: fear of getting hurt again I guess.\nLine 16, 18:58:50: Q. And when did you start riding a bike after\nLine 17, 18:58:50: your prior surgery in, say -- which was I guess\nLine 18, 18:58:50: November of 2000?\nLine 19, 18:58:50: A.

There was some damage done\nLine 10, 19:01:09: to the motor of the car, I think, because I had to\nLine 11, 19:01:09: take it back to Thompson Dodge because it was doing\nLine 12, 19:01:09: so much rattling, and they had to do something to\nLine 13, 19:01:09: the steering.\nLine 14, 19:01:09: Q.

There was no stopping. There was\nLine 11, 19:01:13: nowhere I could just, just slam on the brakes or\nLine 12, 19:01:13: anything. There was no -- it was there.

And what's the purpose of that?\nLine 7, 19:01:23: A. It deadens the nerves, because what\nLine 8, 19:01:23: happens is when you have severe nerve damage, it's\nLine 9, 19:01:23: like electrical impulses going off. It's like\nLine 10, 19:01:23: taking a cord and fraying it and all the electrical ;\nLine 11, 19:01:23: impulses going all over the place. That's what\nLine 12, 19:01:23: causes the pain in the tissues, so what they do is :\nLine 13, 19:01:23: they block it off so it doesn't go down that far.\nLine 14, 19:01:23: It just leaves an even line. |\nLine 15, 19:01:23: Q.

No, he did not.\nLine 13, 19:01:05: Okay. What did the truck do next?\nLine 14, 19:01:05: A. He just basically had gotten into that\nLine 15, 19:01:05: lane when I moved over. He had gotten into that\nLine 16, 19:01:05: lane, and I moved over into my lane.\nLine 17, 19:01:05: Q. Okay.

I'm just estimating, because I had went in\nLine 13, 19:01:23: for Qa, \u00abGUERIN nad wanted me to see a\nLine 14, 19:01:23: all> who specializes in pain management so\nLine 15, 19:01:23: they could do some ganglion stellate blockages to :\nLine 16, 19:01:23: stop the nerve endings from the pain that they were |\nLine 17, 19:01:23: causing, and I had that done at Johns Hopkins on\nLine 18, 19:01:23: December 7th.\nLine 19, 19:01:23: Q. What did you have done at Johns Hopkins on\nLine 20, 19:01:23: December 7th? '\nLine 21, 19:01:23: A. It's called a stellate, S-T-E-L-L-A-G-E,\nLine 22, 19:01:23: ganglion, G-A-L-L-I-O-N, blockage.

And what's the purpose of that?\nLine 7, 19:01:23: A. It deadens the nerves, because what\nLine 8, 19:01:23: happens is when you have severe nerve damage, it's\nLine 9, 19:01:23: like electrical impulses going off. It's like\nLine 10, 19:01:23: taking a cord and fraying it and all the electrical ;\nLine 11, 19:01:23: impulses going all over the place. That's what\nLine 12, 19:01:23: causes the pain in the tissues, so what they do is :\nLine 13, 19:01:23: they block it off so it doesn't go down that far.\nLine 14, 19:01:23: It just leaves an even line. |\nLine 15, 19:01:23: Q.

Ms. Miller, were you present at the intersection of Main Street and Maple\nLine 10, 19:01:36: Avenue on July 15th, 2023, at approximately 3:00 pm?\nLine 11, 19:01:36: Witness: Yes, I was. I was waiting at the red light on Maple Avenue, southbound, facing east.\nLine 12, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: Did you witness any accidents at that intersection at that time?\nLine 13, 19:01:36: Witness: Yes, I did. I saw a car traveling westbound on Main Street, which I believe was a blue sedan, run\nLine 14, 19:01:36: the red light and collide with a car traveling northbound on Maple Avenue, which I believe was a white\nLine 15, 19:01:36: SUV.\nLine 16, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: Can you describe the collision in more detail?\nLine 17, 19:01:36: Witness: The blue sedan seemed to be traveling at a high speed and didn't slow down or attempt to stop\nLine 18, 19:01:36: at the red light. It hit the white SUV directly on the driver's side. The impact was quite forceful, and both\nLine 19, 19:01:36: cars spun around significantly.\nLine 20, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: Ms. Miller, you mentioned the blue sedan was traveling at a high speed. How fast would you\nLine 21, 19:01:36: say it was going?\nLine 22, 19:01:36: Witness: It's difficult to say for sure, but it appeared to be going much faster than the posted speed\nLine 23, 19:01:36: limit, which is 35 miles per hour.\nLine 24, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: Did you see the driver of either vehicle at any point?\nLine 25, 19:01:36: Witness: No, I didn't.\nLine 26, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: Ms. Miller, did you notice anything unusual about the driver's behavior in the blue sedan\nLine 27, 19:01:36: before the accident?\nLine 28, 19:01:36: Witness: It's hard to say. Everything happened very quickly, but the car did seem to be swerving slightly\nLine 29, 19:01:36: just before the collision.\nLine 30, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: Ms. Miller, did you call the police or offer assistance to anyone involved in the accident?\nLine 31, 19:01:36: Witness: Yes, I immediately called 911 and stayed at the scene until the police arrived.\nLine 32, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: Did you speak to anyone else who may have witnessed the accident?\n--- End of Page 1 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 2 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:36: Witness: Yes, I exchanged information with another driver who was stopped next to me on Maple\nLine 2, 19:01:36: Avenue at the time.\nLine 3, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: Do you recall the make and model of the other vehicle that you spoke to?\nLine 4, 19:01:36: Witness: I believe it was a silver Toyota Camry, but I'm not entirely sure.\nLine 5, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: That's all my questions at this time.\nLine 6, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: I have no further questions\nLine 7, 19:01:36: Summary:\nLine 8, 19:01:36: The excerpt is from a legal deposition of Michael Anderson, who is under oath to tell the truth.

Mr. Anderson, please describe any specific incidents or instances at Acme\nLine 4, 19:01:36: that involved your [protected category].\nLine 5, 19:01:36: Witness: There were several things that made me feel uncomfortable. During meetings, colleagues often\nLine 6, 19:01:36: talked over me or dismissed my ideas, particularly when compared to my younger male colleagues. I\nLine 7, 19:01:36: was also consistently passed over for promotions despite having experience and qualifications\nLine 8, 19:01:36: comparable to others who got promoted.\nLine 9, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you be specific about which colleagues treated you this way and provide\nLine 10, 19:01:36: specific examples of situations where these incidents occurred?\nLine 11, 19:01:36: Witness: One specific example would be the marketing campaign for the new product launch in 2023. I\nLine 12, 19:01:36: put significant effort into developing design concepts, but they were ultimately disregarded without any\nLine 13, 19:01:36: explanation. My male colleague's design, which was very similar to mine, was ultimately chosen.\nLine 14, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: Did you ever report any of these incidents to your supervisor or anyone else at Acme?\nLine 15, 19:01:36: Witness: I once mentioned feeling undervalued to my supervisor, but they brushed it off, suggesting I\nLine 16, 19:01:36: needed to \"work harder to prove myself.\" I wasn't comfortable bringing it up further after that.\nLine 17, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: Did you decide to leave Acme voluntarily, or were you terminated?\nLine 18, 19:01:36: Witness: When they announced another promotion I felt qualified for, but was once again passed over\nLine 19, 19:01:36: without explanation, I decided it was time to find a new position where I felt valued and respected.\nLine 20, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you confirm that your decision to leave Acme was solely based on not\nLine 21, 19:01:36: receiving the promotion, and not due to other factors like job performance or personal reasons?\nLine 22, 19:01:36: Witness: To the best of my knowledge, yes. It became clear to me that further advancement\nLine 23, 19:01:36: opportunities within the company were unlikely.\nLine 24, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: That's all my questions at this time.\nLine 25, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, during your time at Acme, did you ever receive any negative performance\nLine 26, 19:01:36: reviews or warnings related to your work performance?\nLine 27, 19:01:36: Witness: No, as mentioned before, my performance reviews were always positive.\nLine 28, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Did you ever attend any diversity and inclusion training offered by Acme during your\nLine 29, 19:01:36: employment?\nLine 30, 19:01:36: Witness: I did participate in the mandatory online training modules, but there weren't any specific\nLine 31, 19:01:36: training sessions related to addressing or reporting potentially discriminatory situations within the\nLine 32, 19:01:36: company.\nLine 33, 19:01:36: Summary\n--- End of Page 3 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 4 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:36: Michael Anderson details specific incidents supporting his feeling of being undervalued based on his\nLine 2, 19:01:36: protected category. He describes colleagues disregarding his ideas and being passed over for\nLine 3, 19:01:36: promotions despite comparable qualifications. He provides a specific example from the 2023 product\nLine 4, 19:01:36: launch where his design was overlooked in favor of a male colleague's similar work. He mentions\nLine 5, 19:01:36: mentioning his concerns to his supervisor but being discouraged from pursuing them. He clarifies his\nLine 6, 19:01:36: decision to leave Acme was due to the lack of advancement opportunities, not performance or personal\nLine 7, 19:01:36: reasons. Ms. Garcia then establishes that Mr. Anderson's performance was consistently good and that\nLine 8, 19:01:36: he participated in available diversity training while at Acme, though specific training for addressing\nLine 9, 19:01:36: potential discrimination was absent.\nLine 10, 19:01:36: Deposition:\nLine 11, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, are you aware of Acme's anti-discrimination policy or how complaints of\nLine 12, 19:01:36: discrimination are addressed within the company?\nLine 13, 19:01:36: Witness: I reviewed the employee handbook, which did explain the existence of an anti-discrimination\nLine 14, 19:01:36: policy. However, I was unsure of the specific complaint process at the time\nLine 15, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you elaborate on why you felt apprehensive about bringing up these\nLine 16, 19:01:36: incidents to your supervisor despite feeling uncomfortable and undervalued?\nLine 17, 19:01:36: Witness: Honestly, there were a few reasons. Firstly, as I mentioned, when I did hint at feeling\nLine 18, 19:01:36: undervalued to my supervisor, their dismissive response discouraged me from further discussions. It\nLine 19, 19:01:36: seemed like they weren't receptive to hearing about any potential issues.\nLine 20, 19:01:36: Secondly, there was a general company culture that made me hesitant to speak up. Younger male\nLine 21, 19:01:36: colleagues often dominated conversations and presentations, and there weren't many women in senior\nLine 22, 19:01:36: positions within the marketing department. It felt like my voice wouldn't be heard or even worse, that\nLine 23, 19:01:36: bringing forward complaints might lead to retaliation or hinder my career further.\nLine 24, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Did you notice any specific instances of retaliation against other employees who may have\nLine 25, 19:01:36: raised complaints or concerns about work environment issues?\nLine 26, 19:01:36: Witness: While I can't say for sure, there was one colleague, Sarah Lopez, who openly challenged gender\nLine 27, 19:01:36: bias during a department meeting but was subsequently given less desirable project assignments\nLine 28, 19:01:36: compared to her male colleagues. This incident definitely reinforced my concerns about potentially\nLine 29, 19:01:36: facing a similar situation.**\nLine 30, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: Objection, speculation about an unrelated case is irrelevant to the present matter.\nLine 31, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Withdrawn. Mr. Anderson, did you ever discuss your concerns about potential bias or lack of\nLine 32, 19:01:36: promotion opportunities with any human resources personnel at Acme?\nLine 33, 19:01:36: Witness: No, I didn't. As I mentioned before, the lack of clarity on the specific complaint process\nLine 34, 19:01:36: combined with the overall culture discouraged me from pursuing that route.\nLine 35, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, since leaving Acme, have you sought employment elsewhere?\n--- End of Page 4 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 5 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, I am currently employed at a different company and feel much more valued and respected\nLine 2, 19:01:37: in my current role. The work environment is significantly more inclusive, and I regularly receive positive\nLine 3, 19:01:37: feedback and opportunities for professional development.\nLine 4, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, how has your experience at Acme impacted you personally and\nLine 5, 19:01:37: professionally?\nLine 6, 19:01:37: Witness: It was definitely a frustrating and discouraging experience. It felt like my hard work and\nLine 7, 19:01:37: qualifications weren't being recognized fairly, leading to some self-doubt and a sense of being\nLine 8, 19:01:37: undervalued. However, finding a new and positive work environment has helped me rebuild my\nLine 9, 19:01:37: confidence and refocus on my career goals.\nLine 10, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: I have no further questions.\nLine 11, 19:01:37: Summary\nLine 12, 19:01:37: This segment explores Mr. Anderson's reasons for not formally complaining despite feeling undervalued.\nLine 13, 19:01:37: He reiterates his supervisor's dismissive response and the perceived lack of receptiveness within the\nLine 14, 19:01:37: company culture. He describes a specific instance where a colleague who challenged gender bias faced\nLine 15, 19:01:37: negative consequences, reinforcing his fear of retaliation. He clarifies that he didn't pursue HR due to\nLine 16, 19:01:37: unclear procedures and the discouraging company culture. Finally, he highlights his positive experience\nLine 17, 19:01:37: at a new company, emphasizing feelings of value, inclusion, and professional growth in contrast to his\nLine 18, 19:01:37: experience at Acme. He concludes by acknowledging the frustration and self-doubt from Acme but also\nLine 19, 19:01:37: the positive impact of finding a supportive work environment.\nLine 20, 19:01:37: Deposition\nLine 21, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: I have one final question. Mr. Anderson, is there anything else you would like to add\nLine 22, 19:01:37: regarding your experience at Acme Corporation?\nLine 23, 19:01:37: Witness: Just that I hope by sharing my story, it can contribute to fostering a more diverse and inclusive\nLine 24, 19:01:37: work environment at Acme for future employees. Everyone deserves to feel valued and respected in\nLine 25, 19:01:37: their workplace, regardless of their [protected category].\nLine 26, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Interesting point, Mr. Anderson. Ms. Garcia, while you have no further questions, I'd like\nLine 27, 19:01:37: to explore some aspects of Mr. Anderson's experience further before concluding the deposition.\nLine 28, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: No objection. Please proceed, Mr. Thompson.\nLine 29, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, you mentioned feeling unsure about the specific complaint process at\nLine 30, 19:01:37: Acme. Did you take any steps to learn more about it after your meeting with your supervisor?\nLine 31, 19:01:37: Witness: No, I didn't feel comfortable approaching my supervisor again after their dismissive response.\nLine 32, 19:01:37: Additionally, I recall the employee handbook being quite lengthy, and finding specific information about\nLine 33, 19:01:37: the complaint process proved difficult at the time.\n--- End of Page 5 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 6 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: You mentioned a colleague, Sarah Lopez, who voiced concerns about gender bias. Did\nLine 2, 19:01:37: you ever speak to her directly about her experience and the alleged retaliation she faced?\nLine 3, 19:01:37: Witness: Briefly, yes. We expressed our mutual frustrations and the feeling of being undervalued within\nLine 4, 19:01:37: the department. However, we were both hesitant to pursue any formal complaints due to the\nLine 5, 19:01:37: aforementioned concerns about the company culture and potential retaliation.\nLine 6, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Did you ever discuss the issue of lack of promotion opportunities with any other\nLine 7, 19:01:37: colleagues, particularly women in the marketing department?\nLine 8, 19:01:37: Witness: Not directly. While there were a few women colleagues in the department, none of them were\nLine 9, 19:01:37: in senior positions. The general environment discouraged open communication about potentially\nLine 10, 19:01:37: sensitive topics like discrimination.\nLine 11, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Thompson, I object to leading the witness. Can you rephrase your question and allow\nLine 12, 19:01:37: Mr. Anderson to answer in his own words?\nLine 13, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Apologies, Ms. Garcia. Mr. Anderson, to clarify, did you have any informal conversations\nLine 14, 19:01:37: with other colleagues about your concerns regarding promotion opportunities or potential gender bias\nLine 15, 19:01:37: within the marketing department at Acme?\nLine 16, 19:01:37: Witness: There weren't any specific discussions about promotions or bias, but the general atmosphere\nLine 17, 19:01:37: around the lack of female representation in senior positions was a frequent topic of quiet observation\nLine 18, 19:01:37: amongst some female colleagues. We felt implicit pressure to work harder and prove ourselves more\nLine 19, 19:01:37: than our male colleagues, but reaching leadership positions seemed like an increasingly distant\nLine 20, 19:01:37: prospect.\nLine 21, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you elaborate on what kind of \"pressure\" you felt, and was there any\nLine 22, 19:01:37: specific instance or behavior from colleagues or superiors that made you feel this way?\nLine 23, 19:01:37: Summary\nLine 24, 19:01:37: In the concluding segment, Mr. Anderson expresses hope that his experience can contribute to a more\nLine 25, 19:01:37: inclusive work environment at Acme. Mr. Thompson then delves deeper into specific aspects of Mr.\nLine 26, 19:01:37: Anderson's experience:\nLine 27, 19:01:37: Complaint process: Mr. Anderson cites discomfort following his supervisor's reaction and difficulty\nLine 28, 19:01:37: navigating the lengthy employee handbook as reasons for not seeking further information.\nLine 29, 19:01:37: Colleague's experience: He mentions briefly discussing his frustrations and concerns with Sarah Lopez\nLine 30, 19:01:37: but clarifies their shared hesitation to pursue formal complaints due to company culture concerns.\nLine 31, 19:01:37: Promotion opportunities and gender bias: He explains the lack of open communication about these\nLine 32, 19:01:37: issues and feeling unspoken pressure due to the absence of women in senior positions, though no\nLine 33, 19:01:37: specific discussions on bias occurred.\nLine 34, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia objects to a leading question about bias, and Mr. Thompson rephrases, allowing Mr.\nLine 35, 19:01:37: Anderson to clarify further. He explains the silent observation among female colleagues of the lack of\n--- End of Page 6 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 7 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:37: female leadership and the perceived need to overachieve compared to male colleagues. Ms. Garcia\nLine 2, 19:01:37: requests further details about the pressure felt by Mr. Anderson.\nLine 3, 19:01:37: Deposition\nLine 4, 19:01:37: Witness: It wasn't any direct confrontation or statement, but more of a subtle feeling arising from\nLine 5, 19:01:37: observing the lack of female representation in leadership roles combined with certain comments about\nLine 6, 19:01:37: needing to \"work harder\" or \"prove myself\" despite my consistent positive performance reviews.\nLine 7, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Thank you, Mr. Anderson. These are valuable insights. Do you have any further\nLine 8, 19:01:37: questions, Ms. Garcia?\nLine 9, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: (after reviewing her notes) I have a few follow-up questions for clarification. However, due\nLine 10, 19:01:37: to the time constraints, I would like to schedule a follow-up session at your earliest convenience, Mr.\nLine 11, 19:01:37: Thompson, to continue exploring specific details and potential evidence.\nLine 12, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: No objection. Mr. Anderson, are you available for a follow-up session within the next\nLine 13, 19:01:37: week?\nLine 14, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, I am available. Please let me know the details when you've scheduled it\nLine 15, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, since our last session, have you had any time to review Acme\nLine 16, 19:01:37: Corporation's employee handbook pertaining to the complaint process for potential discrimination?\nLine 17, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, I have.\nLine 18, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Can you briefly describe the steps outlined in the handbook for filing a complaint based\nLine 19, 19:01:37: on potential discrimination?\nLine 20, 19:01:37: Witness: The handbook mentioned employees could submit a written complaint to the Human\nLine 21, 19:01:37: Resources department or verbally report it to an HR representative or any manager. However, specific\nLine 22, 19:01:37: details about the investigation process or resolution options were quite vague.\nLine 23, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, did the employee handbook specify who constitutes a \"manager\" authorized\nLine 24, 19:01:37: to receive such initial verbal complaints?\nLine 25, 19:01:37: Witness: No, it didn't provide any specific details about which managers were included in that definition\nLine 26, 19:01:37: or if all managers were authorized to receive such reports.\nLine 27, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, you previously mentioned frustration with receiving similar design\nLine 28, 19:01:37: concepts to yours being chosen over your own work while working at Acme. Do you still have copies of\nLine 29, 19:01:37: these original design concepts and the final versions ultimately used?\nLine 30, 19:01:37: Witness: Unfortunately, I didn't retain individual copies of every design iteration. However, I did\nLine 31, 19:01:37: maintain some preliminary sketches and digital drafts from several projects, including the one discussed\nLine 32, 19:01:37: earlier related to the 2023 product launch campaign.\nLine 33, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Would you be willing to provide these materials as potential evidence in this case?\nLine 34, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, I can bring them to the next session.\n--- End of Page 7 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 8 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, are you aware of other colleagues who may have retained copies of their\nLine 2, 19:01:37: rejected design projects or drafts during their employment at Acme?\nLine 3, 19:01:37: Witness: I'm not certain, but I remember several colleagues raising concerns about the inconsistent\nLine 4, 19:01:37: feedback and selection process for design concepts. It's possible some of them might have kept records\nLine 5, 19:01:37: for their own reference.\nLine 6, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: We will look into that possibility. Mr. Anderson, during your time at Acme, did you ever\nLine 7, 19:01:37: meet or hear about any employees who filed official complaints based on experiencing discrimination?\nLine 8, 19:01:37: Witness: Not officially. As mentioned earlier, there was an underlying lack of transparency and open\nLine 9, 19:01:37: communication around potentially sensitive topics like discrimination. Therefore, it was difficult to know\nLine 10, 19:01:37: for sure.\nLine 11, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, did you receive any additional training or workshops related to diversity and\nLine 12, 19:01:37: inclusion since leaving Acme Corporation?\nLine 13, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, my current employer offers comprehensive training programs and workshops regarding\nLine 14, 19:01:37: diversity and inclusion as part of their ongoing commitment to a fair and equitable work environment.\nLine 15, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Do you find these additional training programs and the overall work environment at\nLine 16, 19:01:37: your current company to be beneficial compared to your experience at Acme?\nLine 17, 19:01:37: Witness: Absolutely. The focus on creating a safe space for open communication, valuing diverse\nLine 18, 19:01:37: perspectives, and providing equal opportunities for growth has been incredibly positive and\nLine 19, 19:01:37: empowering.\nLine 20, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: No further questions at this time.\nLine 21, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, as mentioned previously, we would like you to bring copies of the design\nLine 22, 19:01:37: materials you retained for the next session. Additionally, I may reach out to inquire about potential\nLine 23, 19:01:37: colleagues who might have kept similar records. Is that alright?\nLine 24, 19:01:37: Witness: That's perfectly fine. Please let me know if you need anything else in the meantime.\nLine 25, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, one final question before we adjourn. You mentioned feeling hesitant to\nLine 26, 19:01:37: bring up your concerns to your supervisor after their dismissive response. Did their reaction specifically\nLine 27, 19:01:37: mention any consequences of raising the potential bias issue?\nLine 28, 19:01:37: Witness: Not directly. There wasn't an explicit threat of any sort. However, their dismissive tone and the\nLine 29, 19:01:37: implication that my concerns weren't valid created an atmosphere where I felt further discussion would\nLine 30, 19:01:37: be futile and potentially disadvantageous.\nLine 31, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Objection, speculation about the witness's interpretation of a supervisor's tone is not based\nLine 32, 19:01:37: on facts.\nLine 33, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Reframing, Mr. Anderson. How did your supervisor's response make you feel about the\nLine 34, 19:01:37: potential consequences of reporting your concerns?\n--- End of Page 8 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 9 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:38: Witness: Their response discouraged me and made me feel unheard. It conveyed the impression that my\nLine 2, 19:01:38: concerns about potential bias wouldn't be taken seriously and could potentially hinder my career\nLine 3, 19:01:38: progression within the company.\nLine 4, 19:01:38: Summary\nLine 5, 19:01:38: The concluding segment addresses further details and sets the stage for a follow-up session:\nLine 6, 19:01:38: Complaint process: Mr. Anderson reviews the handbook and describes the outlined steps for filing a\nLine 7, 19:01:38: complaint, noting the vagueness regarding investigation and resolution. Ms. Garcia highlights the lack of\nLine 8, 19:01:38: clarity on who qualifies as a \"manager\" authorized to receive initial verbal reports.\nLine 9, 19:01:38: Design concepts: Mr. Anderson clarifies he still possesses some preliminary sketches and drafts,\nLine 10, 19:01:38: including those from the 2023 product launch, and agrees to provide them as potential evidence. Mr.\nLine 11, 19:01:38: Thompson expresses interest in exploring the possibility of other colleagues retaining similar materials.\nLine 12, 19:01:38: Official complaints: Mr. Anderson reiterates the lack of knowledge about any official discrimination\nLine 13, 19:01:38: complaints at Acme due to the previously mentioned culture of secrecy.\nLine 14, 19:01:38: Current company: Mr. Anderson confirms receiving additional diversity and inclusion training at his\nLine 15, 19:01:38: current company. He emphasizes the positive aspects of his new work environment, highlighting open\nLine 16, 19:01:38: communication, valuing diverse perspectives, and equal opportunities, contrasting it with his experience\nLine 17, 19:01:38: at Acme.\nLine 18, 19:01:38: Follow-up: Both parties agree to a follow-up session. Mr. Thompson clarifies his intention to request the\nLine 19, 19:01:38: design materials and potentially contact other colleagues. Ms. Garcia objects to the witness's\nLine 20, 19:01:38: interpretation of his supervisor's tone, leading Mr. Thompson to rephrase the question, to which Mr.\nLine 21, 19:01:38: Anderson reiterates feeling discouraged and unheard, fearing his concerns wouldn't be taken seriously\nLine 22, 19:01:38: and could hinder his career.\nLine 23, 19:01:38: Deposition\nLine 24, 19:01:38: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Thompson, I believe we've covered the essential topics for today. However, as these are\nLine 25, 19:01:38: complex claims, I would appreciate the opportunity to review the transcript and potentially ask further\nLine 26, 19:01:38: questions at a future session, should any need arise.\nLine 27, 19:01:38: Mr. Thompson: No objection. Mr. Anderson, as Ms. Garcia mentioned, we appreciate your willingness to\nLine 28, 19:01:38: cooperate and provide additional materials. We will be in touch to schedule a follow-up session if\nLine 29, 19:01:38: needed.\nLine 30, 19:01:38: Witness: Understood.\nLine 31, 19:01:38: Summary\nLine 32, 19:01:38: The deposition concludes with Ms. Garcia expressing a desire to review the transcript and potentially\nLine 33, 19:01:38: ask further questions in a future session if needed. Mr. Thompson agrees, and both thank Mr. Anderson\nLine 34, 19:01:38: for his cooperation and willingness to provide additional materials. Mr. Anderson acknowledges their\nLine 35, 19:01:38: communication and awaits further information regarding a potential follow-up session.\n--- End of Page 9 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 10 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:38: Deposition\nLine 2, 19:01:38: MILLER: A driver is obligated to pay attention to the road and yield to other drivers when required. Let\nLine 3, 19:01:38: me take you back to what happened on April 20th, 2022. The Defendant, who was an attorney for the\nLine 4, 19:01:38: IRS, was driving her usual route to work. She drove down Annapolis Road to take a left onto another\nLine 5, 19:01:38: road.\nLine 6, 19:01:38: (Could we have the next slide, please?) She was driving down this road\u2026 can everyone see this? She\nLine 7, 19:01:38: stopped at a light on a clear day. While stopped, she reached down to find her parking pass.\nLine 8, 19:01:38: DEFENSE LAWYER: May we approach?\nLine 9, 19:01:38: THE COURT: Yes.\nLine 10, 19:01:38: BENCH CONFERENCE\nLine 11, 19:01:38: (Bench Conference begins \u2013 10:26:39m.)\nLine 12, 19:01:38: (The parties approach the bench for a discussion.)\nLine 13, 19:01:38: THE COURT: By court ruling, liability has been established. The focus of this case is only on damages. I\nLine 14, 19:01:38: understand why we\u2019re discussing these details, but it\u2019s about damages.\nLine 15, 19:01:38: MILLER: I\u2019m setting the scene for the accident because her damages are part of the accident narrative.\nLine 16, 19:01:38: DEFENSE LAWYER: We\u2019re only discussing the fact that an accident happened and a person was injured.\nLine 17, 19:01:38: The details about reaching and negligence seem to be evidence of liability.\nLine 18, 19:01:38: THE COURT: I understand. It\u2019s your opening statement, so I\u2019ll give you some leeway.\nLine 19, 19:01:38: MILLER: I\u2019m just providing context. I\u2019ll be getting into the damages soon.\nLine 20, 19:01:38: THE COURT: Alright.\nLine 21, 19:01:38: (Bench Conference concluded \u2013 10:27:32 m.)\nLine 22, 19:01:38: (The parties return to their places.)\nLine 23, 19:01:38: MILLER: The Defendant heard a horn beep and took a left turn. She didn\u2019t see the Plaintiff, who had the\nLine 24, 19:01:38: right of way, coming from the opposite direction. Due to the collision, the Plaintiff\u2019s ankle was broken\nLine 25, 19:01:38: and required surgery.\nLine 26, 19:01:38: Take a look at these images. The first one shows her ankle before surgery, the second one after surgery.\nLine 27, 19:01:38: Today, she still has 15 screws and three plates in her ankle. She will never be able to run again and\nLine 28, 19:01:38: standing for extended periods of time is difficult.\nLine 29, 19:01:38: We\u2019ve brought this case before you because of the harm caused to the Plaintiff. We needed to agree\nLine 30, 19:01:38: that the Defendant was at fault for the accident, which she has accepted. We also had to understand the\nLine 31, 19:01:38: extent and implications of the Plaintiff\u2019s damages, not just the initial injury and surgery, but also its long-\nLine 32, 19:01:38: term impact on her life.\nLine 33, 19:01:38: To do this, we spoke to her doctors, her husband, her friends, and even her employer. One of her\nLine 34, 19:01:38: doctors is going to talk to you.\n--- End of Page 10 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 11 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:38: This is the guy to see if something awful like this is going to happen to your ankle. He received an Ivy\nLine 2, 19:01:38: League education and, at one point, was the chief of foot and ankle orthopedic injuries at Johns\nLine 3, 19:01:38: Hopkins. He consults for the Baltimore Orioles. His resume, I want to say, is as long as your arm, but it\u2019s\nLine 4, 19:01:38: actually a lot longer than that.\nLine 5, 19:01:38: We\u2019re going to bring him to talk to you guys, in a very 2023 way. It\u2019s going to be by videotape, so his\nLine 6, 19:01:38: testimony will be by videotape, but it holds the same force as if it was at trial, and he came here to see\nLine 7, 19:01:38: us. And, of course, my partner Laura Zois and the defense attorney had an opportunity to ask him\nLine 8, 19:01:38: questions.\nLine 9, 19:01:38: He\u2019s going to tell you she still has 15 screws and three plates in her ankle holding everything together.\nLine 10, 19:01:38: The problem with that is that it creates a breeding ground for arthritis, and this 33-year-old woman\nLine 11, 19:01:38: already has the signs of arthritis. At some point, she\u2019s going to need what\u2019s called a fusion, which will\nLine 12, 19:01:38: stabilize her ankle. The bad news is, you can\u2019t move it once it locks, so you no longer have the ability to\nLine 13, 19:01:38: bend.\nLine 14, 19:01:38: This trial is about the harms and losses that she has suffered and endured as the result of this accident.\nLine 15, 19:01:38: This is not a case about sympathy. You should not award her damages because you feel sorry for her.\nLine 16, 19:01:38: You\u2019re going to hear about how the accident has impacted her professional and personal life.\nLine 17, 19:01:38: At the time of the crash, they were a very young family. They were an energetic family. This is an active\nLine 18, 19:01:38: family with four kids doing everything you can imagine, Six Flags, the park. They would run together.\nLine 19, 19:01:38: They played basketball together. They traveled everywhere, New York, Baltimore, Washington, DC. They\nLine 20, 19:01:38: were just a very active family.\nLine 21, 19:01:38: And she also had a vibrant social life. She was a hairstylist, and she loved that job. It was her social outlet\nLine 22, 19:01:38: beside her kids. She would do the church choir every Wednesday, and still found times to go out and see\nLine 23, 19:01:38: her family. She\u2019s still fighting with her family, but it\u2019s hard.\nLine 24, 19:01:38: She can\u2019t work as a hairstylist anymore. So what did she do? She went back to school to the University\nLine 25, 19:01:38: of Maryland. She\u2019s working, getting very close to getting her degree. She\u2019s still fighting. She has four kids\nLine 26, 19:01:38: they\u2019re chasing around.\nLine 27, 19:01:38: Let\u2019s go back and talk about how it ended up. Let\u2019s talk about the accident. She had this awful crash and\nLine 28, 19:01:38: needed emergency surgery where they put in these screws. She had a nine-month-old baby, along with\nLine 29, 19:01:38: three other kids. She and the two girls, the younger ones, went to live with her mom. Her mom took\nLine 30, 19:01:38: care of her and the girls, while her husband took care of the other kids.\nLine 31, 19:01:38: This has been a massive disruption to their lives. The accident has completely changed her life, and it\u2019s\nLine 32, 19:01:38: reflected in every facet of her day-to-day. Her job, her family life, her hobbies, everything she used to\nLine 33, 19:01:38: take pleasure in has been impacted in one way or another. And the evidence in this case will show these\nLine 34, 19:01:38: changes are likely to persist for the rest of her life.\nLine 35, 19:01:38: We ask you to consider the totality of these changes, the persistent harm and loss she\u2019s suffered and\nLine 36, 19:01:38: will continue to suffer, as a direct result of the accident. We ask you to consider these when coming to a\nLine 37, 19:01:38: decision in this case.\n--- End of Page 11 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 12 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:38: This accident, however, led to an upheaval in their lives. About a month after the accident, she managed\nLine 2, 19:01:38: to return home with the kids. Her mother, an FDA employee, took three months off work to care for her,\nLine 3, 19:01:38: her daughter, and her grandchildren. The accident wreaked havoc on their lives.\nLine 4, 19:01:38: She endured six months of rigorous physical therapy and another operation. While it was painful and\nLine 5, 19:01:38: difficult, the effort was worthwhile as it improved her condition, especially her ankle, though we wish\nLine 6, 19:01:38: she had recovered more.\nLine 7, 19:01:38: As we delve into this case, it\u2019s about the harm and losses experienced. We will ask you to make amends\nLine 8, 19:01:38: where possible and provide compensation for the irreparable harm. The damages can be categorized\nLine 9, 19:01:38: into three parts: her medical bills, the post-accident trauma suffered by her and her family, and the pain\nLine 10, 19:01:38: she will endure for the expected next 45 years of her life.\nLine 11, 19:01:38: She was a spontaneous person, fond of making impromptu plans like going to Virginia Beach over the\nLine 12, 19:01:38: weekend or heading to the park. Now, every activity revolves around her ability to reach there, her\nLine 13, 19:01:38: mobility, and whether she can tolerate the pain during the trip. This situation has affected her and her\nLine 14, 19:01:38: four kids, as well as her husband.\nLine 15, 19:01:38: The court wants to clarify that the evidence and testimonies from the witness stand are what will\nLine 16, 19:01:38: control your deliberations. Opening statements and closing arguments of lawyers do not constitute\nLine 17, 19:01:38: evidence.\nLine 18, 19:01:38: This case is not just about the suffering of their children or her husband. It\u2019s about the impact of their\nLine 19, 19:01:38: suffering on her. We will ask you to consider an amount that may seem high at the beginning. But we\nLine 20, 19:01:38: believe that after hearing all the evidence, you\u2019ll find it to be a fair compensation for her losses and\nLine 21, 19:01:38: harm. The amount we suggest is $1.1 million.\nLine 22, 19:01:38: Defense Opening Statement\nLine 23, 19:01:38: Regarding the defendant, they acknowledge the responsibility for the accident and that it was their\nLine 24, 19:01:38: fault. The case is for you to determine the appropriate damages. The injury is severe, and they ask for an\nLine 25, 19:01:38: extraordinary amount of compensation.\nLine 26, 19:01:38: She broke her ankle, which was repaired surgically with plates and screws. There was a second surgery\nLine 27, 19:01:38: due to loosening of the screws, which were then removed. She attended physical therapy, which\nLine 28, 19:01:38: improved her ability to move her ankle. Whether she will need surgery in the future is uncertain.\nLine 29, 19:01:38: The past medical expenses are around $36,505, which we don\u2019t contest. Her lost wages due to the\nLine 30, 19:01:38: accident are around $3,400 to $3,500. These are not the focal points of this case. The main issue is the\nLine 31, 19:01:38: amount to be awarded for non-economic damages, for which we request something fair, reasonable,\nLine 32, 19:01:38: and sensible.\nLine 33, 19:01:38: Thank you for your time and attention, and we hope to conclude this case promptly.\nLine 34, 19:01:38: Testimony of Victim\u2019s Husband\nLine 35, 19:01:38: Mr. Miller: Good morning. Can I have your address?\nLine 36, 19:01:38: SJ: Certainly.\nLine 37, 19:01:38: Mr. Miller: How long have you lived at that address?\n--- End of Page 12 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 13 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: SJ: I bought the house in 2003, so it\u2019s been approximately ten years.\nLine 2, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Who lives there with you?\nLine 3, 19:01:39: SJ: My wife, and our four children.\nLine 4, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Can you tell the jury how old your children are and their names?\nLine 5, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes. My children are 13, and the others are\u2026\nLine 6, 19:01:39: The Honorable Judge: Please continue.\nLine 7, 19:01:39: SJ: \u2026five, and three.\nLine 8, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: I understand. And for some background, what do you do for a living?\nLine 9, 19:01:39: SJ: I\u2019m currently the general manager at Oreck Clean Home Center.\nLine 10, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: And where are these locations?\nLine 11, 19:01:39: SJ: We have six locations in Maryland and Virginia.\nLine 12, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: What are your responsibilities at work?\nLine 13, 19:01:39: SJ: I oversee all six stores and manage one of them.\nLine 14, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Can you describe your work schedule?\nLine 15, 19:01:39: SJ: I work Monday through Saturday, from 10:00 am to 7:00 pm. Often, I work seven days a week which\nLine 16, 19:01:39: means working on Sundays from 12:00 pm to 5:00 pm.\nLine 17, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: How do you feel about those hours?\nLine 18, 19:01:39: SJ: They are long, but I need to work to support my family.\nLine 19, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: How long have you known your wife?\nLine 20, 19:01:39: SJ: I met her in 1993, she was my sister\u2019s best friend.\nLine 21, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: You mean your wife was your sister\u2019s best friend?\nLine 22, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes, I apologize for the confusion. She was indeed my sister\u2019s best friend.\nLine 23, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Let\u2019s move to another topic. Do you remember the car accident your wife was in 2022?\nLine 24, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes, I do.\nLine 25, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Prior to the accident, can you describe your household?\nLine 26, 19:01:39: SJ: Our household was what I would consider the perfect life. My wife and children were happy and\nLine 27, 19:01:39: always engaged in activities. We used to take vacations and attend family reunions.\nLine 28, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Was your wife a spontaneous person or a planner?\nLine 29, 19:01:39: SJ: She was more spontaneous, always ready to take on new activities.\n--- End of Page 13 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 14 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Could you describe her for the jury?\nLine 2, 19:01:39: SJ: She is always happy, loves socializing and helping people. She attended choir rehearsal, Bible study\nLine 3, 19:01:39: every week, and also took care of our four children.\nLine 4, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: What was her job at the time of the crash?\nLine 5, 19:01:39: SJ: She was the assistant manager of a hair salon.\nLine 6, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Did she enjoy her work?\nLine 7, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes, she loved her work. It was part of her identity.\nLine 8, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Did your wife\u2019s demeanor change after the car accident?\nLine 9, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes, after the accident everything changed. Our family life and activity level changed significantly. She\nLine 10, 19:01:39: used to take the children to sporting events and practice basketball. Now, she can\u2019t do these activities.\nLine 11, 19:01:39: She no longer goes on family vacations. My two older sons call her \u201cboring\u201d now because of her reduced\nLine 12, 19:01:39: activity level. The accident has restricted her capabilities and as a result, she can\u2019t even do simple tasks\nLine 13, 19:01:39: like carrying laundry baskets or standing up to cook. Our family life has changed drastically since the\nLine 14, 19:01:39: accident.\nLine 15, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Has your wife gone back to work since the accident?\nLine 16, 19:01:39: SJ: She tried to help a friend out a couple of months ago at her hair salon, but it ended with her in a lot\nLine 17, 19:01:39: of pain due to the swelling in her ankle.\nLine 18, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: I have here a picture you received from your wife. Is this the picture she sent you?\nLine 19, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Can you tell us how your wife\u2019s personal social life has been affected since the crash?\nLine 20, 19:01:39: SJ: Her social life has indeed changed significantly. Before the accident, she would regularly go out with\nLine 21, 19:01:39: friends, engage in dancing, and other social activities. However, the constant pain and discomfort after\nLine 22, 19:01:39: the crash have made such activities impossible. Her social life is definitely not the same as before.\nLine 23, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: You mentioned earlier about her job. Was she able to resume work post the crash?\nLine 24, 19:01:39: SJ: She attempted to return to work, but the persistent pain made it unmanageable, particularly the\nLine 25, 19:01:39: long-standing hours. Eventually, she was forced to leave her job.\nLine 26, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: How has this situation impacted your family\u2019s finances?\nLine 27, 19:01:39: SJ: The impact has been substantial. She held the position of an assistant manager at a hair salon,\nLine 28, 19:01:39: bringing in a significant income. Now, with my single income, managing expenses for our four children\nLine 29, 19:01:39: and her medical bills has been strenuous.\nLine 30, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Besides the financial struggle, can you share how your relationship with your wife has\nLine 31, 19:01:39: evolved post the accident?\nLine 32, 19:01:39: SJ: Our relationship has undeniably been affected. She isn\u2019t the same person she was before the crash.\nLine 33, 19:01:39: Her constant pain and fatigue, coupled with frustration, have been hard on both of us.\nLine 34, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: And your children? How have they been coping with all these changes?\n--- End of Page 14 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 15 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: SJ: Our children have had to make significant adjustments. They miss the mother they had before the\nLine 2, 19:01:39: crash, not understanding why she can\u2019t engage in the activities she used to do with them. My older\nLine 3, 19:01:39: sons, in particular, have had to step up, assisting more with household chores. It\u2019s been a lot for them\nLine 4, 19:01:39: too.\nLine 5, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Finally, could you share your hopes for your wife\u2019s future?\nLine 6, 19:01:39: SJ: My biggest hope is for her to find relief from her pain and regain some semblance of normalcy. She\nLine 7, 19:01:39: deserves to live her life, not just endure it. It\u2019s challenging to see such a wonderful person go through\nLine 8, 19:01:39: this.

Do you\nLine 13, 19:01:39: have one?\nLine 14, 19:01:39: A: Indeed, we do have an exercise bike at home.\nLine 15, 19:01:39: Q: Did she frequently use the exercise bike, especially post-accident?\nLine 16, 19:01:39: A: Initially, during her therapy, they had her try riding the exercise bike.\nLine 17, 19:01:39: Q: Can you tell us what kind of exercises she did at home after the accident?\nLine 18, 19:01:39: A: She was given a chart with exercises, and I\u2019ve been helping her to flex her foot in both directions to\nLine 19, 19:01:39: try and loosen it up.\nLine 20, 19:01:39: Q: How long did this routine last?\nLine 21, 19:01:39: A: Actually, I still assist her with the foot exercises every night.\nLine 22, 19:01:39: Q: So you assist her based on the instructions from the chart?\nLine 23, 19:01:39: A: Not directly from the chart, but I\u2019ve learned the correct angles and try to flex her foot every night for\nLine 24, 19:01:39: her comfort and to aid her sleep.\nLine 25, 19:01:39: Q: Does she drive?\nLine 26, 19:01:39: A: Yes, she does.\nLine 27, 19:01:39: Q: Prior to the accident, she was employed full time?\nLine 28, 19:01:39: A: Yes, that\u2019s correct.\nLine 29, 19:01:39: Q: The jury was informed initially that she was also pursuing a degree?\nLine 30, 19:01:39: A: Yes, she was attending the University of Maryland.\nLine 31, 19:01:39: Q: Did she commute to the university?\nLine 32, 19:01:39: A: At certain points she did, but due to our four children, she primarily takes her classes online now.\n--- End of Page 15 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 16 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: Q: How close is she to obtaining her degree?\nLine 2, 19:01:39: A: She\u2019s expected to graduate within the next year.\nLine 3, 19:01:39: Court: Any redirect?\nLine 4, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: No further questions, Your Honor.\nLine 5, 19:01:39: Court: Thank you, sir, you may step down.

Here's a concise summary:\nLine 10, 19:01:39: Before the accident:\nLine 11, 19:01:39: The family was described as happy and engaged in activities, including vacations and family reunions.\nLine 12, 19:01:39: The wife was spontaneous, sociable, and involved in various activities like choir, bible study, and caring\nLine 13, 19:01:39: for their four children.\nLine 14, 19:01:39: She enjoyed her work as an assistant manager at a hair salon.\nLine 15, 19:01:39: After the accident:\nLine 16, 19:01:39: The family life and activity level significantly changed.\nLine 17, 19:01:39: The wife's physical limitations restrict her participation in activities like taking children to events, playing\nLine 18, 19:01:39: sports, or going on family vacations.\nLine 19, 19:01:39: Her reduced activity has even affected how their children perceive her, calling her \"boring.\"\nLine 20, 19:01:39: She struggles with simple tasks like carrying laundry or cooking.\nLine 21, 19:01:39: Impact on the family:\nLine 22, 19:01:39: The wife attempted but couldn't return to work due to pain and difficulty managing long hours.\nLine 23, 19:01:39: The financial burden increased significantly with a single income supporting the family and medical bills.\nLine 24, 19:01:39: The strain on the wife due to pain and frustration has impacted their relationship.\nLine 25, 19:01:39: The children have had to adjust and take on more responsibilities, missing their previous active mother.\nLine 26, 19:01:39: Husband's hope for the future:\nLine 27, 19:01:39: He desires for his wife to find pain relief and regain normalcy in her life.\nLine 28, 19:01:39: Defense cross-examination:\nLine 29, 19:01:39: The husband assists with the wife's foot exercises based on instructions from a chart.\nLine 30, 19:01:39: She still drives and is pursuing a degree online while caring for their children.\n--- End of Page 16 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 17 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: She expects to graduate within the next year.\n--- End of Page 17 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 1 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:53: Deposition:\nLine 2, 19:20:53: Court Reporter: Please state your name for the record.\nLine 3, 19:20:53: Witness: Sarah Miller.\nLine 4, 19:20:53: Court Reporter: And how do you spell your last name, Ms. Miller?\nLine 5, 19:20:53: Witness: M-I-L-L-E-R.\nLine 6, 19:20:53: Mr. Brown: Ms. Miller, are you aware that today's proceedings are a legal deposition and that you are\nLine 7, 19:20:53: under oath to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?\nLine 8, 19:20:53: Witness: Yes, I am aware.\nLine 9, 19:20:53: Mr. Brown: Thank you. Ms. Miller, were you present at the intersection of Main Street and Maple\nLine 10, 19:20:53: Avenue on July 15th, 2023, at approximately 3:00 pm?\nLine 11, 19:20:53: Witness: Yes, I was. I was waiting at the red light on Maple Avenue, southbound, facing east.\nLine 12, 19:20:53: Mr. Brown: Did you witness any accidents at that intersection at that time?\nLine 13, 19:20:53: Witness: Yes, I did. I saw a car traveling westbound on Main Street, which I believe was a blue sedan, run\nLine 14, 19:20:53: the red light and collide with a car traveling northbound on Maple Avenue, which I believe was a white\nLine 15, 19:20:53: SUV.\nLine 16, 19:20:53: Mr. Brown: Can you describe the collision in more detail?\nLine 17, 19:20:53: Witness: The blue sedan seemed to be traveling at a high speed and didn't slow down or attempt to stop\nLine 18, 19:20:53: at the red light. It hit the white SUV directly on the driver's side. The impact was quite forceful, and both\nLine 19, 19:20:53: cars spun around significantly.\nLine 20, 19:20:53: Mr. Lee: Ms. Miller, you mentioned the blue sedan was traveling at a high speed. How fast would you\nLine 21, 19:20:53: say it was going?\nLine 22, 19:20:53: Witness: It's difficult to say for sure, but it appeared to be going much faster than the posted speed\nLine 23, 19:20:53: limit, which is 35 miles per hour.\nLine 24, 19:20:53: Mr. Lee: Did you see the driver of either vehicle at any point?\nLine 25, 19:20:53: Witness: No, I didn't.\nLine 26, 19:20:53: Mr. Brown: Ms. Miller, did you notice anything unusual about the driver's behavior in the blue sedan\nLine 27, 19:20:53: before the accident?\nLine 28, 19:20:53: Witness: It's hard to say. Everything happened very quickly, but the car did seem to be swerving slightly\nLine 29, 19:20:53: just before the collision.\nLine 30, 19:20:53: Mr. Lee: Ms. Miller, did you call the police or offer assistance to anyone involved in the accident?\nLine 31, 19:20:53: Witness: Yes, I immediately called 911 and stayed at the scene until the police arrived.\nLine 32, 19:20:53: Mr. Brown: Did you speak to anyone else who may have witnessed the accident?\n--- End of Page 1 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 2 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:53: Witness: Yes, I exchanged information with another driver who was stopped next to me on Maple\nLine 2, 19:20:53: Avenue at the time.\nLine 3, 19:20:53: Mr. Lee: Do you recall the make and model of the other vehicle that you spoke to?\nLine 4, 19:20:53: Witness: I believe it was a silver Toyota Camry, but I'm not entirely sure.\nLine 5, 19:20:53: Mr. Brown: That's all my questions at this time.\nLine 6, 19:20:53: Mr. Lee: I have no further questions\nLine 7, 19:20:53: Summary:\nLine 8, 19:20:53: The excerpt is from a legal deposition of Michael Anderson, who is under oath to tell the truth. Mr.\nLine 9, 19:20:53: Anderson confirms his employment at Acme Corporation as a graphic designer and details his job duties.\nLine 10, 19:20:53: He also confirms receiving positive performance reviews and never facing disciplinary actions. The\nLine 11, 19:20:53: excerpt ends with a question about witnessing or experiencing any discriminatory situations at Acme.\n--- End of Page 2 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 3 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:53: Deposition:\nLine 2, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Objection, that question calls for legal conclusions from the witness.\nLine 3, 19:20:53: Mr. Thompson: Withdrawn. Mr. Anderson, please describe any specific incidents or instances at Acme\nLine 4, 19:20:53: that involved your [protected category].\nLine 5, 19:20:53: Witness: There were several things that made me feel uncomfortable. During meetings, colleagues often\nLine 6, 19:20:53: talked over me or dismissed my ideas, particularly when compared to my younger male colleagues. I\nLine 7, 19:20:53: was also consistently passed over for promotions despite having experience and qualifications\nLine 8, 19:20:53: comparable to others who got promoted.\nLine 9, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you be specific about which colleagues treated you this way and provide\nLine 10, 19:20:53: specific examples of situations where these incidents occurred?\nLine 11, 19:20:53: Witness: One specific example would be the marketing campaign for the new product launch in 2023. I\nLine 12, 19:20:53: put significant effort into developing design concepts, but they were ultimately disregarded without any\nLine 13, 19:20:53: explanation. My male colleague's design, which was very similar to mine, was ultimately chosen.\nLine 14, 19:20:53: Mr. Thompson: Did you ever report any of these incidents to your supervisor or anyone else at Acme?\nLine 15, 19:20:53: Witness: I once mentioned feeling undervalued to my supervisor, but they brushed it off, suggesting I\nLine 16, 19:20:53: needed to \"work harder to prove myself.\" I wasn't comfortable bringing it up further after that.\nLine 17, 19:20:53: Mr. Thompson: Did you decide to leave Acme voluntarily, or were you terminated?\nLine 18, 19:20:53: Witness: When they announced another promotion I felt qualified for, but was once again passed over\nLine 19, 19:20:53: without explanation, I decided it was time to find a new position where I felt valued and respected.\nLine 20, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you confirm that your decision to leave Acme was solely based on not\nLine 21, 19:20:53: receiving the promotion, and not due to other factors like job performance or personal reasons?\nLine 22, 19:20:53: Witness: To the best of my knowledge, yes. It became clear to me that further advancement\nLine 23, 19:20:53: opportunities within the company were unlikely.\nLine 24, 19:20:53: Mr. Thompson: That's all my questions at this time.\nLine 25, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, during your time at Acme, did you ever receive any negative performance\nLine 26, 19:20:53: reviews or warnings related to your work performance?\nLine 27, 19:20:53: Witness: No, as mentioned before, my performance reviews were always positive.\nLine 28, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Did you ever attend any diversity and inclusion training offered by Acme during your\nLine 29, 19:20:53: employment?\nLine 30, 19:20:53: Witness: I did participate in the mandatory online training modules, but there weren't any specific\nLine 31, 19:20:53: training sessions related to addressing or reporting potentially discriminatory situations within the\nLine 32, 19:20:53: company.\nLine 33, 19:20:53: Summary\n--- End of Page 3 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 4 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:53: Michael Anderson details specific incidents supporting his feeling of being undervalued based on his\nLine 2, 19:20:53: protected category. He describes colleagues disregarding his ideas and being passed over for\nLine 3, 19:20:53: promotions despite comparable qualifications. He provides a specific example from the 2023 product\nLine 4, 19:20:53: launch where his design was overlooked in favor of a male colleague's similar work. He mentions\nLine 5, 19:20:53: mentioning his concerns to his supervisor but being discouraged from pursuing them. He clarifies his\nLine 6, 19:20:53: decision to leave Acme was due to the lack of advancement opportunities, not performance or personal\nLine 7, 19:20:53: reasons. Ms. Garcia then establishes that Mr. Anderson's performance was consistently good and that\nLine 8, 19:20:53: he participated in available diversity training while at Acme, though specific training for addressing\nLine 9, 19:20:53: potential discrimination was absent.\nLine 10, 19:20:53: Deposition:\nLine 11, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, are you aware of Acme's anti-discrimination policy or how complaints of\nLine 12, 19:20:53: discrimination are addressed within the company?\nLine 13, 19:20:53: Witness: I reviewed the employee handbook, which did explain the existence of an anti-discrimination\nLine 14, 19:20:53: policy. However, I was unsure of the specific complaint process at the time\nLine 15, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you elaborate on why you felt apprehensive about bringing up these\nLine 16, 19:20:53: incidents to your supervisor despite feeling uncomfortable and undervalued?\nLine 17, 19:20:53: Witness: Honestly, there were a few reasons. Firstly, as I mentioned, when I did hint at feeling\nLine 18, 19:20:53: undervalued to my supervisor, their dismissive response discouraged me from further discussions. It\nLine 19, 19:20:53: seemed like they weren't receptive to hearing about any potential issues.\nLine 20, 19:20:53: Secondly, there was a general company culture that made me hesitant to speak up. Younger male\nLine 21, 19:20:53: colleagues often dominated conversations and presentations, and there weren't many women in senior\nLine 22, 19:20:53: positions within the marketing department. It felt like my voice wouldn't be heard or even worse, that\nLine 23, 19:20:53: bringing forward complaints might lead to retaliation or hinder my career further.\nLine 24, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Did you notice any specific instances of retaliation against other employees who may have\nLine 25, 19:20:53: raised complaints or concerns about work environment issues?\nLine 26, 19:20:53: Witness: While I can't say for sure, there was one colleague, Sarah Lopez, who openly challenged gender\nLine 27, 19:20:53: bias during a department meeting but was subsequently given less desirable project assignments\nLine 28, 19:20:53: compared to her male colleagues. This incident definitely reinforced my concerns about potentially\nLine 29, 19:20:53: facing a similar situation.**\nLine 30, 19:20:53: Mr. Thompson: Objection, speculation about an unrelated case is irrelevant to the present matter.\nLine 31, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Withdrawn. Mr. Anderson, did you ever discuss your concerns about potential bias or lack of\nLine 32, 19:20:53: promotion opportunities with any human resources personnel at Acme?\nLine 33, 19:20:53: Witness: No, I didn't. As I mentioned before, the lack of clarity on the specific complaint process\nLine 34, 19:20:53: combined with the overall culture discouraged me from pursuing that route.\nLine 35, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, since leaving Acme, have you sought employment elsewhere?\n--- End of Page 4 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 5 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:54: Witness: Yes, I am currently employed at a different company and feel much more valued and respected\nLine 2, 19:20:54: in my current role. The work environment is significantly more inclusive, and I regularly receive positive\nLine 3, 19:20:54: feedback and opportunities for professional development.\nLine 4, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, how has your experience at Acme impacted you personally and\nLine 5, 19:20:54: professionally?\nLine 6, 19:20:54: Witness: It was definitely a frustrating and discouraging experience. It felt like my hard work and\nLine 7, 19:20:54: qualifications weren't being recognized fairly, leading to some self-doubt and a sense of being\nLine 8, 19:20:54: undervalued. However, finding a new and positive work environment has helped me rebuild my\nLine 9, 19:20:54: confidence and refocus on my career goals.\nLine 10, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: I have no further questions.\nLine 11, 19:20:54: Summary\nLine 12, 19:20:54: This segment explores Mr. Anderson's reasons for not formally complaining despite feeling undervalued.\nLine 13, 19:20:54: He reiterates his supervisor's dismissive response and the perceived lack of receptiveness within the\nLine 14, 19:20:54: company culture. He describes a specific instance where a colleague who challenged gender bias faced\nLine 15, 19:20:54: negative consequences, reinforcing his fear of retaliation. He clarifies that he didn't pursue HR due to\nLine 16, 19:20:54: unclear procedures and the discouraging company culture. Finally, he highlights his positive experience\nLine 17, 19:20:54: at a new company, emphasizing feelings of value, inclusion, and professional growth in contrast to his\nLine 18, 19:20:54: experience at Acme. He concludes by acknowledging the frustration and self-doubt from Acme but also\nLine 19, 19:20:54: the positive impact of finding a supportive work environment.\nLine 20, 19:20:54: Deposition\nLine 21, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: I have one final question. Mr. Anderson, is there anything else you would like to add\nLine 22, 19:20:54: regarding your experience at Acme Corporation?\nLine 23, 19:20:54: Witness: Just that I hope by sharing my story, it can contribute to fostering a more diverse and inclusive\nLine 24, 19:20:54: work environment at Acme for future employees. Everyone deserves to feel valued and respected in\nLine 25, 19:20:54: their workplace, regardless of their [protected category].\nLine 26, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Interesting point, Mr. Anderson. Ms. Garcia, while you have no further questions, I'd like\nLine 27, 19:20:54: to explore some aspects of Mr. Anderson's experience further before concluding the deposition.\nLine 28, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: No objection. Please proceed, Mr. Thompson.\nLine 29, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, you mentioned feeling unsure about the specific complaint process at\nLine 30, 19:20:54: Acme. Did you take any steps to learn more about it after your meeting with your supervisor?\nLine 31, 19:20:54: Witness: No, I didn't feel comfortable approaching my supervisor again after their dismissive response.\nLine 32, 19:20:54: Additionally, I recall the employee handbook being quite lengthy, and finding specific information about\nLine 33, 19:20:54: the complaint process proved difficult at the time.\n--- End of Page 5 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 6 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: You mentioned a colleague, Sarah Lopez, who voiced concerns about gender bias. Did\nLine 2, 19:20:54: you ever speak to her directly about her experience and the alleged retaliation she faced?\nLine 3, 19:20:54: Witness: Briefly, yes. We expressed our mutual frustrations and the feeling of being undervalued within\nLine 4, 19:20:54: the department. However, we were both hesitant to pursue any formal complaints due to the\nLine 5, 19:20:54: aforementioned concerns about the company culture and potential retaliation.\nLine 6, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Did you ever discuss the issue of lack of promotion opportunities with any other\nLine 7, 19:20:54: colleagues, particularly women in the marketing department?\nLine 8, 19:20:54: Witness: Not directly. While there were a few women colleagues in the department, none of them were\nLine 9, 19:20:54: in senior positions. The general environment discouraged open communication about potentially\nLine 10, 19:20:54: sensitive topics like discrimination.\nLine 11, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Thompson, I object to leading the witness. Can you rephrase your question and allow\nLine 12, 19:20:54: Mr. Anderson to answer in his own words?\nLine 13, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Apologies, Ms. Garcia. Mr. Anderson, to clarify, did you have any informal conversations\nLine 14, 19:20:54: with other colleagues about your concerns regarding promotion opportunities or potential gender bias\nLine 15, 19:20:54: within the marketing department at Acme?\nLine 16, 19:20:54: Witness: There weren't any specific discussions about promotions or bias, but the general atmosphere\nLine 17, 19:20:54: around the lack of female representation in senior positions was a frequent topic of quiet observation\nLine 18, 19:20:54: amongst some female colleagues. We felt implicit pressure to work harder and prove ourselves more\nLine 19, 19:20:54: than our male colleagues, but reaching leadership positions seemed like an increasingly distant\nLine 20, 19:20:54: prospect.\nLine 21, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you elaborate on what kind of \"pressure\" you felt, and was there any\nLine 22, 19:20:54: specific instance or behavior from colleagues or superiors that made you feel this way?\nLine 23, 19:20:54: Summary\nLine 24, 19:20:54: In the concluding segment, Mr. Anderson expresses hope that his experience can contribute to a more\nLine 25, 19:20:54: inclusive work environment at Acme. Mr. Thompson then delves deeper into specific aspects of Mr.\nLine 26, 19:20:54: Anderson's experience:\nLine 27, 19:20:54: Complaint process: Mr. Anderson cites discomfort following his supervisor's reaction and difficulty\nLine 28, 19:20:54: navigating the lengthy employee handbook as reasons for not seeking further information.\nLine 29, 19:20:54: Colleague's experience: He mentions briefly discussing his frustrations and concerns with Sarah Lopez\nLine 30, 19:20:54: but clarifies their shared hesitation to pursue formal complaints due to company culture concerns.\nLine 31, 19:20:54: Promotion opportunities and gender bias: He explains the lack of open communication about these\nLine 32, 19:20:54: issues and feeling unspoken pressure due to the absence of women in senior positions, though no\nLine 33, 19:20:54: specific discussions on bias occurred.\nLine 34, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia objects to a leading question about bias, and Mr. Thompson rephrases, allowing Mr.\nLine 35, 19:20:54: Anderson to clarify further. He explains the silent observation among female colleagues of the lack of\n--- End of Page 6 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 7 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:54: female leadership and the perceived need to overachieve compared to male colleagues. Ms. Garcia\nLine 2, 19:20:54: requests further details about the pressure felt by Mr. Anderson.\nLine 3, 19:20:54: Deposition\nLine 4, 19:20:54: Witness: It wasn't any direct confrontation or statement, but more of a subtle feeling arising from\nLine 5, 19:20:54: observing the lack of female representation in leadership roles combined with certain comments about\nLine 6, 19:20:54: needing to \"work harder\" or \"prove myself\" despite my consistent positive performance reviews.\nLine 7, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Thank you, Mr. Anderson. These are valuable insights. Do you have any further\nLine 8, 19:20:54: questions, Ms. Garcia?\nLine 9, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: (after reviewing her notes) I have a few follow-up questions for clarification. However, due\nLine 10, 19:20:54: to the time constraints, I would like to schedule a follow-up session at your earliest convenience, Mr.\nLine 11, 19:20:54: Thompson, to continue exploring specific details and potential evidence.\nLine 12, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: No objection. Mr. Anderson, are you available for a follow-up session within the next\nLine 13, 19:20:54: week?\nLine 14, 19:20:54: Witness: Yes, I am available. Please let me know the details when you've scheduled it\nLine 15, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, since our last session, have you had any time to review Acme\nLine 16, 19:20:54: Corporation's employee handbook pertaining to the complaint process for potential discrimination?\nLine 17, 19:20:54: Witness: Yes, I have.\nLine 18, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Can you briefly describe the steps outlined in the handbook for filing a complaint based\nLine 19, 19:20:54: on potential discrimination?\nLine 20, 19:20:54: Witness: The handbook mentioned employees could submit a written complaint to the Human\nLine 21, 19:20:54: Resources department or verbally report it to an HR representative or any manager. However, specific\nLine 22, 19:20:54: details about the investigation process or resolution options were quite vague.\nLine 23, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, did the employee handbook specify who constitutes a \"manager\" authorized\nLine 24, 19:20:54: to receive such initial verbal complaints?\nLine 25, 19:20:54: Witness: No, it didn't provide any specific details about which managers were included in that definition\nLine 26, 19:20:54: or if all managers were authorized to receive such reports.\nLine 27, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, you previously mentioned frustration with receiving similar design\nLine 28, 19:20:54: concepts to yours being chosen over your own work while working at Acme. Do you still have copies of\nLine 29, 19:20:54: these original design concepts and the final versions ultimately used?\nLine 30, 19:20:54: Witness: Unfortunately, I didn't retain individual copies of every design iteration. However, I did\nLine 31, 19:20:54: maintain some preliminary sketches and digital drafts from several projects, including the one discussed\nLine 32, 19:20:54: earlier related to the 2023 product launch campaign.\nLine 33, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Would you be willing to provide these materials as potential evidence in this case?\nLine 34, 19:20:54: Witness: Yes, I can bring them to the next session.\n--- End of Page 7 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 8 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, are you aware of other colleagues who may have retained copies of their\nLine 2, 19:20:54: rejected design projects or drafts during their employment at Acme?\nLine 3, 19:20:54: Witness: I'm not certain, but I remember several colleagues raising concerns about the inconsistent\nLine 4, 19:20:54: feedback and selection process for design concepts. It's possible some of them might have kept records\nLine 5, 19:20:54: for their own reference.\nLine 6, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: We will look into that possibility. Mr. Anderson, during your time at Acme, did you ever\nLine 7, 19:20:54: meet or hear about any employees who filed official complaints based on experiencing discrimination?\nLine 8, 19:20:54: Witness: Not officially. As mentioned earlier, there was an underlying lack of transparency and open\nLine 9, 19:20:54: communication around potentially sensitive topics like discrimination. Therefore, it was difficult to know\nLine 10, 19:20:54: for sure.\nLine 11, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, did you receive any additional training or workshops related to diversity and\nLine 12, 19:20:54: inclusion since leaving Acme Corporation?\nLine 13, 19:20:54: Witness: Yes, my current employer offers comprehensive training programs and workshops regarding\nLine 14, 19:20:54: diversity and inclusion as part of their ongoing commitment to a fair and equitable work environment.\nLine 15, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Do you find these additional training programs and the overall work environment at\nLine 16, 19:20:54: your current company to be beneficial compared to your experience at Acme?\nLine 17, 19:20:54: Witness: Absolutely. The focus on creating a safe space for open communication, valuing diverse\nLine 18, 19:20:54: perspectives, and providing equal opportunities for growth has been incredibly positive and\nLine 19, 19:20:54: empowering.\nLine 20, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: No further questions at this time.\nLine 21, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, as mentioned previously, we would like you to bring copies of the design\nLine 22, 19:20:54: materials you retained for the next session. Additionally, I may reach out to inquire about potential\nLine 23, 19:20:54: colleagues who might have kept similar records. Is that alright?\nLine 24, 19:20:54: Witness: That's perfectly fine. Please let me know if you need anything else in the meantime.\nLine 25, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, one final question before we adjourn. You mentioned feeling hesitant to\nLine 26, 19:20:54: bring up your concerns to your supervisor after their dismissive response. Did their reaction specifically\nLine 27, 19:20:54: mention any consequences of raising the potential bias issue?\nLine 28, 19:20:54: Witness: Not directly. There wasn't an explicit threat of any sort. However, their dismissive tone and the\nLine 29, 19:20:54: implication that my concerns weren't valid created an atmosphere where I felt further discussion would\nLine 30, 19:20:54: be futile and potentially disadvantageous.\nLine 31, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: Objection, speculation about the witness's interpretation of a supervisor's tone is not based\nLine 32, 19:20:54: on facts.\nLine 33, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Reframing, Mr. Anderson. How did your supervisor's response make you feel about the\nLine 34, 19:20:54: potential consequences of reporting your concerns?\n--- End of Page 8 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 9 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:55: Witness: Their response discouraged me and made me feel unheard. It conveyed the impression that my\nLine 2, 19:20:55: concerns about potential bias wouldn't be taken seriously and could potentially hinder my career\nLine 3, 19:20:55: progression within the company.\nLine 4, 19:20:55: Summary\nLine 5, 19:20:55: The concluding segment addresses further details and sets the stage for a follow-up session:\nLine 6, 19:20:55: Complaint process: Mr. Anderson reviews the handbook and describes the outlined steps for filing a\nLine 7, 19:20:55: complaint, noting the vagueness regarding investigation and resolution. Ms. Garcia highlights the lack of\nLine 8, 19:20:55: clarity on who qualifies as a \"manager\" authorized to receive initial verbal reports.\nLine 9, 19:20:55: Design concepts: Mr. Anderson clarifies he still possesses some preliminary sketches and drafts,\nLine 10, 19:20:55: including those from the 2023 product launch, and agrees to provide them as potential evidence. Mr.\nLine 11, 19:20:55: Thompson expresses interest in exploring the possibility of other colleagues retaining similar materials.\nLine 12, 19:20:55: Official complaints: Mr. Anderson reiterates the lack of knowledge about any official discrimination\nLine 13, 19:20:55: complaints at Acme due to the previously mentioned culture of secrecy.\nLine 14, 19:20:55: Current company: Mr. Anderson confirms receiving additional diversity and inclusion training at his\nLine 15, 19:20:55: current company. He emphasizes the positive aspects of his new work environment, highlighting open\nLine 16, 19:20:55: communication, valuing diverse perspectives, and equal opportunities, contrasting it with his experience\nLine 17, 19:20:55: at Acme.\nLine 18, 19:20:55: Follow-up: Both parties agree to a follow-up session. Mr. Thompson clarifies his intention to request the\nLine 19, 19:20:55: design materials and potentially contact other colleagues. Ms. Garcia objects to the witness's\nLine 20, 19:20:55: interpretation of his supervisor's tone, leading Mr. Thompson to rephrase the question, to which Mr.\nLine 21, 19:20:55: Anderson reiterates feeling discouraged and unheard, fearing his concerns wouldn't be taken seriously\nLine 22, 19:20:55: and could hinder his career.\nLine 23, 19:20:55: Deposition\nLine 24, 19:20:55: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Thompson, I believe we've covered the essential topics for today. However, as these are\nLine 25, 19:20:55: complex claims, I would appreciate the opportunity to review the transcript and potentially ask further\nLine 26, 19:20:55: questions at a future session, should any need arise.\nLine 27, 19:20:55: Mr. Thompson: No objection. Mr. Anderson, as Ms. Garcia mentioned, we appreciate your willingness to\nLine 28, 19:20:55: cooperate and provide additional materials. We will be in touch to schedule a follow-up session if\nLine 29, 19:20:55: needed.\nLine 30, 19:20:55: Witness: Understood.\nLine 31, 19:20:55: Summary\nLine 32, 19:20:55: The deposition concludes with Ms. Garcia expressing a desire to review the transcript and potentially\nLine 33, 19:20:55: ask further questions in a future session if needed. Mr. Thompson agrees, and both thank Mr. Anderson\nLine 34, 19:20:55: for his cooperation and willingness to provide additional materials. Mr. Anderson acknowledges their\nLine 35, 19:20:55: communication and awaits further information regarding a potential follow-up session.\n--- End of Page 9 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 10 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:55: Deposition\nLine 2, 19:20:55: MILLER: A driver is obligated to pay attention to the road and yield to other drivers when required. Let\nLine 3, 19:20:55: me take you back to what happened on April 20th, 2022. The Defendant, who was an attorney for the\nLine 4, 19:20:55: IRS, was driving her usual route to work. She drove down Annapolis Road to take a left onto another\nLine 5, 19:20:55: road.\nLine 6, 19:20:55: (Could we have the next slide, please?) She was driving down this road\u2026 can everyone see this? She\nLine 7, 19:20:55: stopped at a light on a clear day. While stopped, she reached down to find her parking pass.\nLine 8, 19:20:55: DEFENSE LAWYER: May we approach?\nLine 9, 19:20:55: THE COURT: Yes.\nLine 10, 19:20:55: BENCH CONFERENCE\nLine 11, 19:20:55: (Bench Conference begins \u2013 10:26:39m.)\nLine 12, 19:20:55: (The parties approach the bench for a discussion.)\nLine 13, 19:20:55: THE COURT: By court ruling, liability has been established. The focus of this case is only on damages. I\nLine 14, 19:20:55: understand why we\u2019re discussing these details, but it\u2019s about damages.\nLine 15, 19:20:55: MILLER: I\u2019m setting the scene for the accident because her damages are part of the accident narrative.\nLine 16, 19:20:55: DEFENSE LAWYER: We\u2019re only discussing the fact that an accident happened and a person was injured.\nLine 17, 19:20:55: The details about reaching and negligence seem to be evidence of liability.\nLine 18, 19:20:55: THE COURT: I understand. It\u2019s your opening statement, so I\u2019ll give you some leeway.\nLine 19, 19:20:55: MILLER: I\u2019m just providing context. I\u2019ll be getting into the damages soon.\nLine 20, 19:20:55: THE COURT: Alright.\nLine 21, 19:20:55: (Bench Conference concluded \u2013 10:27:32 m.)\nLine 22, 19:20:55: (The parties return to their places.)\nLine 23, 19:20:55: MILLER: The Defendant heard a horn beep and took a left turn. She didn\u2019t see the Plaintiff, who had the\nLine 24, 19:20:55: right of way, coming from the opposite direction. Due to the collision, the Plaintiff\u2019s ankle was broken\nLine 25, 19:20:55: and required surgery.\nLine 26, 19:20:55: Take a look at these images. The first one shows her ankle before surgery, the second one after surgery.\nLine 27, 19:20:55: Today, she still has 15 screws and three plates in her ankle. She will never be able to run again and\nLine 28, 19:20:55: standing for extended periods of time is difficult.\nLine 29, 19:20:55: We\u2019ve brought this case before you because of the harm caused to the Plaintiff. We needed to agree\nLine 30, 19:20:55: that the Defendant was at fault for the accident, which she has accepted. We also had to understand the\nLine 31, 19:20:55: extent and implications of the Plaintiff\u2019s damages, not just the initial injury and surgery, but also its long-\nLine 32, 19:20:55: term impact on her life.\nLine 33, 19:20:55: To do this, we spoke to her doctors, her husband, her friends, and even her employer. One of her\nLine 34, 19:20:55: doctors is going to talk to you.\n--- End of Page 10 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 11 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:55: This is the guy to see if something awful like this is going to happen to your ankle. He received an Ivy\nLine 2, 19:20:55: League education and, at one point, was the chief of foot and ankle orthopedic injuries at Johns\nLine 3, 19:20:55: Hopkins. He consults for the Baltimore Orioles. His resume, I want to say, is as long as your arm, but it\u2019s\nLine 4, 19:20:55: actually a lot longer than that.\nLine 5, 19:20:55: We\u2019re going to bring him to talk to you guys, in a very 2023 way. It\u2019s going to be by videotape, so his\nLine 6, 19:20:55: testimony will be by videotape, but it holds the same force as if it was at trial, and he came here to see\nLine 7, 19:20:55: us. And, of course, my partner Laura Zois and the defense attorney had an opportunity to ask him\nLine 8, 19:20:55: questions.\nLine 9, 19:20:55: He\u2019s going to tell you she still has 15 screws and three plates in her ankle holding everything together.\nLine 10, 19:20:55: The problem with that is that it creates a breeding ground for arthritis, and this 33-year-old woman\nLine 11, 19:20:55: already has the signs of arthritis. At some point, she\u2019s going to need what\u2019s called a fusion, which will\nLine 12, 19:20:55: stabilize her ankle. The bad news is, you can\u2019t move it once it locks, so you no longer have the ability to\nLine 13, 19:20:55: bend.\nLine 14, 19:20:55: This trial is about the harms and losses that she has suffered and endured as the result of this accident.\nLine 15, 19:20:55: This is not a case about sympathy. You should not award her damages because you feel sorry for her.\nLine 16, 19:20:55: You\u2019re going to hear about how the accident has impacted her professional and personal life.\nLine 17, 19:20:55: At the time of the crash, they were a very young family. They were an energetic family. This is an active\nLine 18, 19:20:55: family with four kids doing everything you can imagine, Six Flags, the park. They would run together.\nLine 19, 19:20:55: They played basketball together. They traveled everywhere, New York, Baltimore, Washington, DC. They\nLine 20, 19:20:55: were just a very active family.\nLine 21, 19:20:55: And she also had a vibrant social life. She was a hairstylist, and she loved that job. It was her social outlet\nLine 22, 19:20:55: beside her kids. She would do the church choir every Wednesday, and still found times to go out and see\nLine 23, 19:20:55: her family. She\u2019s still fighting with her family, but it\u2019s hard.\nLine 24, 19:20:55: She can\u2019t work as a hairstylist anymore. So what did she do? She went back to school to the University\nLine 25, 19:20:55: of Maryland. She\u2019s working, getting very close to getting her degree. She\u2019s still fighting. She has four kids\nLine 26, 19:20:55: they\u2019re chasing around.\nLine 27, 19:20:55: Let\u2019s go back and talk about how it ended up. Let\u2019s talk about the accident. She had this awful crash and\nLine 28, 19:20:55: needed emergency surgery where they put in these screws. She had a nine-month-old baby, along with\nLine 29, 19:20:55: three other kids. She and the two girls, the younger ones, went to live with her mom. Her mom took\nLine 30, 19:20:55: care of her and the girls, while her husband took care of the other kids.\nLine 31, 19:20:55: This has been a massive disruption to their lives. The accident has completely changed her life, and it\u2019s\nLine 32, 19:20:55: reflected in every facet of her day-to-day. Her job, her family life, her hobbies, everything she used to\nLine 33, 19:20:55: take pleasure in has been impacted in one way or another. And the evidence in this case will show these\nLine 34, 19:20:55: changes are likely to persist for the rest of her life.\nLine 35, 19:20:55: We ask you to consider the totality of these changes, the persistent harm and loss she\u2019s suffered and\nLine 36, 19:20:55: will continue to suffer, as a direct result of the accident. We ask you to consider these when coming to a\nLine 37, 19:20:55: decision in this case.\n--- End of Page 11 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 12 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:55: This accident, however, led to an upheaval in their lives. About a month after the accident, she managed\nLine 2, 19:20:55: to return home with the kids. Her mother, an FDA employee, took three months off work to care for her,\nLine 3, 19:20:55: her daughter, and her grandchildren. The accident wreaked havoc on their lives.\nLine 4, 19:20:55: She endured six months of rigorous physical therapy and another operation. While it was painful and\nLine 5, 19:20:55: difficult, the effort was worthwhile as it improved her condition, especially her ankle, though we wish\nLine 6, 19:20:55: she had recovered more.\nLine 7, 19:20:55: As we delve into this case, it\u2019s about the harm and losses experienced. We will ask you to make amends\nLine 8, 19:20:55: where possible and provide compensation for the irreparable harm. The damages can be categorized\nLine 9, 19:20:55: into three parts: her medical bills, the post-accident trauma suffered by her and her family, and the pain\nLine 10, 19:20:55: she will endure for the expected next 45 years of her life.\nLine 11, 19:20:55: She was a spontaneous person, fond of making impromptu plans like going to Virginia Beach over the\nLine 12, 19:20:55: weekend or heading to the park. Now, every activity revolves around her ability to reach there, her\nLine 13, 19:20:55: mobility, and whether she can tolerate the pain during the trip. This situation has affected her and her\nLine 14, 19:20:55: four kids, as well as her husband.\nLine 15, 19:20:55: The court wants to clarify that the evidence and testimonies from the witness stand are what will\nLine 16, 19:20:55: control your deliberations. Opening statements and closing arguments of lawyers do not constitute\nLine 17, 19:20:55: evidence.\nLine 18, 19:20:55: This case is not just about the suffering of their children or her husband. It\u2019s about the impact of their\nLine 19, 19:20:55: suffering on her. We will ask you to consider an amount that may seem high at the beginning. But we\nLine 20, 19:20:55: believe that after hearing all the evidence, you\u2019ll find it to be a fair compensation for her losses and\nLine 21, 19:20:55: harm. The amount we suggest is $1.1 million.\nLine 22, 19:20:55: Defense Opening Statement\nLine 23, 19:20:55: Regarding the defendant, they acknowledge the responsibility for the accident and that it was their\nLine 24, 19:20:55: fault. The case is for you to determine the appropriate damages. The injury is severe, and they ask for an\nLine 25, 19:20:55: extraordinary amount of compensation.\nLine 26, 19:20:55: She broke her ankle, which was repaired surgically with plates and screws. There was a second surgery\nLine 27, 19:20:55: due to loosening of the screws, which were then removed. She attended physical therapy, which\nLine 28, 19:20:55: improved her ability to move her ankle. Whether she will need surgery in the future is uncertain.\nLine 29, 19:20:55: The past medical expenses are around $36,505, which we don\u2019t contest. Her lost wages due to the\nLine 30, 19:20:55: accident are around $3,400 to $3,500. These are not the focal points of this case. The main issue is the\nLine 31, 19:20:55: amount to be awarded for non-economic damages, for which we request something fair, reasonable,\nLine 32, 19:20:55: and sensible.\nLine 33, 19:20:55: Thank you for your time and attention, and we hope to conclude this case promptly.\nLine 34, 19:20:55: Testimony of Victim\u2019s Husband\nLine 35, 19:20:55: Mr. Miller: Good morning. Can I have your address?\nLine 36, 19:20:55: SJ: Certainly.\nLine 37, 19:20:55: Mr. Miller: How long have you lived at that address?\n--- End of Page 12 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 13 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:56: SJ: I bought the house in 2003, so it\u2019s been approximately ten years.\nLine 2, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Who lives there with you?\nLine 3, 19:20:56: SJ: My wife, and our four children.\nLine 4, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Can you tell the jury how old your children are and their names?\nLine 5, 19:20:56: SJ: Yes. My children are 13, and the others are\u2026\nLine 6, 19:20:56: The Honorable Judge: Please continue.\nLine 7, 19:20:56: SJ: \u2026five, and three.\nLine 8, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: I understand. And for some background, what do you do for a living?\nLine 9, 19:20:56: SJ: I\u2019m currently the general manager at Oreck Clean Home Center.\nLine 10, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: And where are these locations?\nLine 11, 19:20:56: SJ: We have six locations in Maryland and Virginia.\nLine 12, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: What are your responsibilities at work?\nLine 13, 19:20:56: SJ: I oversee all six stores and manage one of them.\nLine 14, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Can you describe your work schedule?\nLine 15, 19:20:56: SJ: I work Monday through Saturday, from 10:00 am to 7:00 pm. Often, I work seven days a week which\nLine 16, 19:20:56: means working on Sundays from 12:00 pm to 5:00 pm.\nLine 17, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: How do you feel about those hours?\nLine 18, 19:20:56: SJ: They are long, but I need to work to support my family.\nLine 19, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: How long have you known your wife?\nLine 20, 19:20:56: SJ: I met her in 1993, she was my sister\u2019s best friend.\nLine 21, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: You mean your wife was your sister\u2019s best friend?\nLine 22, 19:20:56: SJ: Yes, I apologize for the confusion. She was indeed my sister\u2019s best friend.\nLine 23, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Let\u2019s move to another topic. Do you remember the car accident your wife was in 2022?\nLine 24, 19:20:56: SJ: Yes, I do.\nLine 25, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Prior to the accident, can you describe your household?\nLine 26, 19:20:56: SJ: Our household was what I would consider the perfect life. My wife and children were happy and\nLine 27, 19:20:56: always engaged in activities. We used to take vacations and attend family reunions.\nLine 28, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Was your wife a spontaneous person or a planner?\nLine 29, 19:20:56: SJ: She was more spontaneous, always ready to take on new activities.\n--- End of Page 13 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 14 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Could you describe her for the jury?\nLine 2, 19:20:56: SJ: She is always happy, loves socializing and helping people. She attended choir rehearsal, Bible study\nLine 3, 19:20:56: every week, and also took care of our four children.\nLine 4, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: What was her job at the time of the crash?\nLine 5, 19:20:56: SJ: She was the assistant manager of a hair salon.\nLine 6, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Did she enjoy her work?\nLine 7, 19:20:56: SJ: Yes, she loved her work. It was part of her identity.\nLine 8, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Did your wife\u2019s demeanor change after the car accident?\nLine 9, 19:20:56: SJ: Yes, after the accident everything changed. Our family life and activity level changed significantly. She\nLine 10, 19:20:56: used to take the children to sporting events and practice basketball. Now, she can\u2019t do these activities.\nLine 11, 19:20:56: She no longer goes on family vacations. My two older sons call her \u201cboring\u201d now because of her reduced\nLine 12, 19:20:56: activity level. The accident has restricted her capabilities and as a result, she can\u2019t even do simple tasks\nLine 13, 19:20:56: like carrying laundry baskets or standing up to cook. Our family life has changed drastically since the\nLine 14, 19:20:56: accident.\nLine 15, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Has your wife gone back to work since the accident?\nLine 16, 19:20:56: SJ: She tried to help a friend out a couple of months ago at her hair salon, but it ended with her in a lot\nLine 17, 19:20:56: of pain due to the swelling in her ankle.\nLine 18, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: I have here a picture you received from your wife. Is this the picture she sent you?\nLine 19, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Can you tell us how your wife\u2019s personal social life has been affected since the crash?\nLine 20, 19:20:56: SJ: Her social life has indeed changed significantly. Before the accident, she would regularly go out with\nLine 21, 19:20:56: friends, engage in dancing, and other social activities. However, the constant pain and discomfort after\nLine 22, 19:20:56: the crash have made such activities impossible. Her social life is definitely not the same as before.\nLine 23, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: You mentioned earlier about her job. Was she able to resume work post the crash?\nLine 24, 19:20:56: SJ: She attempted to return to work, but the persistent pain made it unmanageable, particularly the\nLine 25, 19:20:56: long-standing hours. Eventually, she was forced to leave her job.\nLine 26, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: How has this situation impacted your family\u2019s finances?\nLine 27, 19:20:56: SJ: The impact has been substantial. She held the position of an assistant manager at a hair salon,\nLine 28, 19:20:56: bringing in a significant income. Now, with my single income, managing expenses for our four children\nLine 29, 19:20:56: and her medical bills has been strenuous.\nLine 30, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Besides the financial struggle, can you share how your relationship with your wife has\nLine 31, 19:20:56: evolved post the accident?\nLine 32, 19:20:56: SJ: Our relationship has undeniably been affected. She isn\u2019t the same person she was before the crash.\nLine 33, 19:20:56: Her constant pain and fatigue, coupled with frustration, have been hard on both of us.\nLine 34, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: And your children? How have they been coping with all these changes?\n--- End of Page 14 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 15 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:56: SJ: Our children have had to make significant adjustments. They miss the mother they had before the\nLine 2, 19:20:56: crash, not understanding why she can\u2019t engage in the activities she used to do with them. My older\nLine 3, 19:20:56: sons, in particular, have had to step up, assisting more with household chores. It\u2019s been a lot for them\nLine 4, 19:20:56: too.\nLine 5, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Finally, could you share your hopes for your wife\u2019s future?\nLine 6, 19:20:56: SJ: My biggest hope is for her to find relief from her pain and regain some semblance of normalcy. She\nLine 7, 19:20:56: deserves to live her life, not just endure it. It\u2019s challenging to see such a wonderful person go through\nLine 8, 19:20:56: this. We are taking each day as it comes, hoping for a better future.\nLine 9, 19:20:56: Defense Attorney Cross Examination of Victim\u2019s Husband\nLine 10, 19:20:56: Q: Regarding the foot stretching exercises, you assist her with those?\nLine 11, 19:20:56: A: Yes, I do.\nLine 12, 19:20:56: Q: Looking through her medical records, I noticed there\u2019s mention of an exercise bike at home. Do you\nLine 13, 19:20:56: have one?\nLine 14, 19:20:56: A: Indeed, we do have an exercise bike at home.\nLine 15, 19:20:56: Q: Did she frequently use the exercise bike, especially post-accident?\nLine 16, 19:20:56: A: Initially, during her therapy, they had her try riding the exercise bike.\nLine 17, 19:20:56: Q: Can you tell us what kind of exercises she did at home after the accident?\nLine 18, 19:20:56: A: She was given a chart with exercises, and I\u2019ve been helping her to flex her foot in both directions to\nLine 19, 19:20:56: try and loosen it up.\nLine 20, 19:20:56: Q: How long did this routine last?\nLine 21, 19:20:56: A: Actually, I still assist her with the foot exercises every night.\nLine 22, 19:20:56: Q: So you assist her based on the instructions from the chart?\nLine 23, 19:20:56: A: Not directly from the chart, but I\u2019ve learned the correct angles and try to flex her foot every night for\nLine 24, 19:20:56: her comfort and to aid her sleep.\nLine 25, 19:20:56: Q: Does she drive?\nLine 26, 19:20:56: A: Yes, she does.\nLine 27, 19:20:56: Q: Prior to the accident, she was employed full time?\nLine 28, 19:20:56: A: Yes, that\u2019s correct.\nLine 29, 19:20:56: Q: The jury was informed initially that she was also pursuing a degree?\nLine 30, 19:20:56: A: Yes, she was attending the University of Maryland.\nLine 31, 19:20:56: Q: Did she commute to the university?\nLine 32, 19:20:56: A: At certain points she did, but due to our four children, she primarily takes her classes online now.\n--- End of Page 15 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 16 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:56: Q: How close is she to obtaining her degree?\nLine 2, 19:20:56: A: She\u2019s expected to graduate within the next year.\nLine 3, 19:20:56: Court: Any redirect?\nLine 4, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: No further questions, Your Honor.\nLine 5, 19:20:56: Court: Thank you, sir, you may step down.

Here's a concise summary:\nLine 10, 19:20:56: Before the accident:\nLine 11, 19:20:56: The family was described as happy and engaged in activities, including vacations and family reunions.\nLine 12, 19:20:56: The wife was spontaneous, sociable, and involved in various activities like choir, bible study, and caring\nLine 13, 19:20:56: for their four children.\nLine 14, 19:20:56: She enjoyed her work as an assistant manager at a hair salon.\nLine 15, 19:20:56: After the accident:\nLine 16, 19:20:56: The family life and activity level significantly changed.\nLine 17, 19:20:56: The wife's physical limitations restrict her participation in activities like taking children to events, playing\nLine 18, 19:20:56: sports, or going on family vacations.\nLine 19, 19:20:56: Her reduced activity has even affected how their children perceive her, calling her \"boring.\"\nLine 20, 19:20:56: She struggles with simple tasks like carrying laundry or cooking.\nLine 21, 19:20:56: Impact on the family:\nLine 22, 19:20:56: The wife attempted but couldn't return to work due to pain and difficulty managing long hours.\nLine 23, 19:20:56: The financial burden increased significantly with a single income supporting the family and medical bills.\nLine 24, 19:20:56: The strain on the wife due to pain and frustration has impacted their relationship.\nLine 25, 19:20:56: The children have had to adjust and take on more responsibilities, missing their previous active mother.\nLine 26, 19:20:56: Husband's hope for the future:\nLine 27, 19:20:56: He desires for his wife to find pain relief and regain normalcy in her life.\nLine 28, 19:20:56: Defense cross-examination:\nLine 29, 19:20:56: The husband assists with the wife's foot exercises based on instructions from a chart.\nLine 30, 19:20:56: She still drives and is pursuing a degree online while caring for their children.\n--- End of Page 16 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 17 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:56: She expects to graduate within the next year.\n--- End of Page 17 ---", "summary": "--- Beginning of Page 1 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: Dummy Summary one\n--- End of Page 1 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 1 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:57: Dummy Summary one\n--- End of Page 1 ---", "text": "<s>[INST] Provide a summary of the following : --- Beginning of Page 1 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:36: Deposition:\nLine 2, 19:01:36: Court Reporter: Please state your name for the record.\nLine 3, 19:01:36: Witness: Sarah Miller.\nLine 4, 19:01:36: Court Reporter: And how do you spell your last name, Ms. Miller?\nLine 5, 19:01:36: Witness: M-I-L-L-E-R.\nLine 6, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: Ms. Miller, are you aware that today's proceedings are a legal deposition and that you are\nLine 7, 19:01:36: under oath to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?\nLine 8, 19:01:36: Witness: Yes, I am aware.\nLine 9, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: Thank you. Ms. Miller, were you present at the intersection of Main Street and Maple\nLine 10, 19:01:36: Avenue on July 15th, 2023, at approximately 3:00 pm?\nLine 11, 19:01:36: Witness: Yes, I was. I was waiting at the red light on Maple Avenue, southbound, facing east.\nLine 12, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: Did you witness any accidents at that intersection at that time?\nLine 13, 19:01:36: Witness: Yes, I did. I saw a car traveling westbound on Main Street, which I believe was a blue sedan, run\nLine 14, 19:01:36: the red light and collide with a car traveling northbound on Maple Avenue, which I believe was a white\nLine 15, 19:01:36: SUV.\nLine 16, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: Can you describe the collision in more detail?\nLine 17, 19:01:36: Witness: The blue sedan seemed to be traveling at a high speed and didn't slow down or attempt to stop\nLine 18, 19:01:36: at the red light. It hit the white SUV directly on the driver's side. The impact was quite forceful, and both\nLine 19, 19:01:36: cars spun around significantly.\nLine 20, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: Ms. Miller, you mentioned the blue sedan was traveling at a high speed. How fast would you\nLine 21, 19:01:36: say it was going?\nLine 22, 19:01:36: Witness: It's difficult to say for sure, but it appeared to be going much faster than the posted speed\nLine 23, 19:01:36: limit, which is 35 miles per hour.\nLine 24, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: Did you see the driver of either vehicle at any point?\nLine 25, 19:01:36: Witness: No, I didn't.\nLine 26, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: Ms. Miller, did you notice anything unusual about the driver's behavior in the blue sedan\nLine 27, 19:01:36: before the accident?\nLine 28, 19:01:36: Witness: It's hard to say. Everything happened very quickly, but the car did seem to be swerving slightly\nLine 29, 19:01:36: just before the collision.\nLine 30, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: Ms. Miller, did you call the police or offer assistance to anyone involved in the accident?\nLine 31, 19:01:36: Witness: Yes, I immediately called 911 and stayed at the scene until the police arrived.\nLine 32, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: Did you speak to anyone else who may have witnessed the accident?\n--- End of Page 1 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 2 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:36: Witness: Yes, I exchanged information with another driver who was stopped next to me on Maple\nLine 2, 19:01:36: Avenue at the time.\nLine 3, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: Do you recall the make and model of the other vehicle that you spoke to?\nLine 4, 19:01:36: Witness: I believe it was a silver Toyota Camry, but I'm not entirely sure.\nLine 5, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: That's all my questions at this time.\nLine 6, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: I have no further questions\nLine 7, 19:01:36: Summary:\nLine 8, 19:01:36: The excerpt is from a legal deposition of Michael Anderson, who is under oath to tell the truth. Mr.\nLine 9, 19:01:36: Anderson confirms his employment at Acme Corporation as a graphic designer and details his job duties.\nLine 10, 19:01:36: He also confirms receiving positive performance reviews and never facing disciplinary actions.

Mr. Anderson, please describe any specific incidents or instances at Acme\nLine 4, 19:01:36: that involved your [protected category].\nLine 5, 19:01:36: Witness: There were several things that made me feel uncomfortable. During meetings, colleagues often\nLine 6, 19:01:36: talked over me or dismissed my ideas, particularly when compared to my younger male colleagues. I\nLine 7, 19:01:36: was also consistently passed over for promotions despite having experience and qualifications\nLine 8, 19:01:36: comparable to others who got promoted.\nLine 9, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you be specific about which colleagues treated you this way and provide\nLine 10, 19:01:36: specific examples of situations where these incidents occurred?\nLine 11, 19:01:36: Witness: One specific example would be the marketing campaign for the new product launch in 2023. I\nLine 12, 19:01:36: put significant effort into developing design concepts, but they were ultimately disregarded without any\nLine 13, 19:01:36: explanation. My male colleague's design, which was very similar to mine, was ultimately chosen.\nLine 14, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: Did you ever report any of these incidents to your supervisor or anyone else at Acme?\nLine 15, 19:01:36: Witness: I once mentioned feeling undervalued to my supervisor, but they brushed it off, suggesting I\nLine 16, 19:01:36: needed to \"work harder to prove myself.\" I wasn't comfortable bringing it up further after that.\nLine 17, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: Did you decide to leave Acme voluntarily, or were you terminated?\nLine 18, 19:01:36: Witness: When they announced another promotion I felt qualified for, but was once again passed over\nLine 19, 19:01:36: without explanation, I decided it was time to find a new position where I felt valued and respected.\nLine 20, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you confirm that your decision to leave Acme was solely based on not\nLine 21, 19:01:36: receiving the promotion, and not due to other factors like job performance or personal reasons?\nLine 22, 19:01:36: Witness: To the best of my knowledge, yes. It became clear to me that further advancement\nLine 23, 19:01:36: opportunities within the company were unlikely.\nLine 24, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: That's all my questions at this time.\nLine 25, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, during your time at Acme, did you ever receive any negative performance\nLine 26, 19:01:36: reviews or warnings related to your work performance?\nLine 27, 19:01:36: Witness: No, as mentioned before, my performance reviews were always positive.\nLine 28, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Did you ever attend any diversity and inclusion training offered by Acme during your\nLine 29, 19:01:36: employment?\nLine 30, 19:01:36: Witness: I did participate in the mandatory online training modules, but there weren't any specific\nLine 31, 19:01:36: training sessions related to addressing or reporting potentially discriminatory situations within the\nLine 32, 19:01:36: company.\nLine 33, 19:01:36: Summary\n--- End of Page 3 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 4 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:36: Michael Anderson details specific incidents supporting his feeling of being undervalued based on his\nLine 2, 19:01:36: protected category. He describes colleagues disregarding his ideas and being passed over for\nLine 3, 19:01:36: promotions despite comparable qualifications. He provides a specific example from the 2023 product\nLine 4, 19:01:36: launch where his design was overlooked in favor of a male colleague's similar work. He mentions\nLine 5, 19:01:36: mentioning his concerns to his supervisor but being discouraged from pursuing them. He clarifies his\nLine 6, 19:01:36: decision to leave Acme was due to the lack of advancement opportunities, not performance or personal\nLine 7, 19:01:36: reasons. Ms. Garcia then establishes that Mr. Anderson's performance was consistently good and that\nLine 8, 19:01:36: he participated in available diversity training while at Acme, though specific training for addressing\nLine 9, 19:01:36: potential discrimination was absent.\nLine 10, 19:01:36: Deposition:\nLine 11, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, are you aware of Acme's anti-discrimination policy or how complaints of\nLine 12, 19:01:36: discrimination are addressed within the company?\nLine 13, 19:01:36: Witness: I reviewed the employee handbook, which did explain the existence of an anti-discrimination\nLine 14, 19:01:36: policy. However, I was unsure of the specific complaint process at the time\nLine 15, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you elaborate on why you felt apprehensive about bringing up these\nLine 16, 19:01:36: incidents to your supervisor despite feeling uncomfortable and undervalued?\nLine 17, 19:01:36: Witness: Honestly, there were a few reasons. Firstly, as I mentioned, when I did hint at feeling\nLine 18, 19:01:36: undervalued to my supervisor, their dismissive response discouraged me from further discussions. It\nLine 19, 19:01:36: seemed like they weren't receptive to hearing about any potential issues.\nLine 20, 19:01:36: Secondly, there was a general company culture that made me hesitant to speak up. Younger male\nLine 21, 19:01:36: colleagues often dominated conversations and presentations, and there weren't many women in senior\nLine 22, 19:01:36: positions within the marketing department. It felt like my voice wouldn't be heard or even worse, that\nLine 23, 19:01:36: bringing forward complaints might lead to retaliation or hinder my career further.\nLine 24, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Did you notice any specific instances of retaliation against other employees who may have\nLine 25, 19:01:36: raised complaints or concerns about work environment issues?\nLine 26, 19:01:36: Witness: While I can't say for sure, there was one colleague, Sarah Lopez, who openly challenged gender\nLine 27, 19:01:36: bias during a department meeting but was subsequently given less desirable project assignments\nLine 28, 19:01:36: compared to her male colleagues. This incident definitely reinforced my concerns about potentially\nLine 29, 19:01:36: facing a similar situation.**\nLine 30, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: Objection, speculation about an unrelated case is irrelevant to the present matter.\nLine 31, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Withdrawn. Mr. Anderson, did you ever discuss your concerns about potential bias or lack of\nLine 32, 19:01:36: promotion opportunities with any human resources personnel at Acme?\nLine 33, 19:01:36: Witness: No, I didn't. As I mentioned before, the lack of clarity on the specific complaint process\nLine 34, 19:01:36: combined with the overall culture discouraged me from pursuing that route.\nLine 35, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, since leaving Acme, have you sought employment elsewhere?\n--- End of Page 4 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 5 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, I am currently employed at a different company and feel much more valued and respected\nLine 2, 19:01:37: in my current role. The work environment is significantly more inclusive, and I regularly receive positive\nLine 3, 19:01:37: feedback and opportunities for professional development.\nLine 4, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, how has your experience at Acme impacted you personally and\nLine 5, 19:01:37: professionally?\nLine 6, 19:01:37: Witness: It was definitely a frustrating and discouraging experience. It felt like my hard work and\nLine 7, 19:01:37: qualifications weren't being recognized fairly, leading to some self-doubt and a sense of being\nLine 8, 19:01:37: undervalued. However, finding a new and positive work environment has helped me rebuild my\nLine 9, 19:01:37: confidence and refocus on my career goals.\nLine 10, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: I have no further questions.\nLine 11, 19:01:37: Summary\nLine 12, 19:01:37: This segment explores Mr. Anderson's reasons for not formally complaining despite feeling undervalued.\nLine 13, 19:01:37: He reiterates his supervisor's dismissive response and the perceived lack of receptiveness within the\nLine 14, 19:01:37: company culture. He describes a specific instance where a colleague who challenged gender bias faced\nLine 15, 19:01:37: negative consequences, reinforcing his fear of retaliation. He clarifies that he didn't pursue HR due to\nLine 16, 19:01:37: unclear procedures and the discouraging company culture. Finally, he highlights his positive experience\nLine 17, 19:01:37: at a new company, emphasizing feelings of value, inclusion, and professional growth in contrast to his\nLine 18, 19:01:37: experience at Acme. He concludes by acknowledging the frustration and self-doubt from Acme but also\nLine 19, 19:01:37: the positive impact of finding a supportive work environment.\nLine 20, 19:01:37: Deposition\nLine 21, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: I have one final question. Mr. Anderson, is there anything else you would like to add\nLine 22, 19:01:37: regarding your experience at Acme Corporation?\nLine 23, 19:01:37: Witness: Just that I hope by sharing my story, it can contribute to fostering a more diverse and inclusive\nLine 24, 19:01:37: work environment at Acme for future employees. Everyone deserves to feel valued and respected in\nLine 25, 19:01:37: their workplace, regardless of their [protected category].\nLine 26, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Interesting point, Mr. Anderson. Ms. Garcia, while you have no further questions, I'd like\nLine 27, 19:01:37: to explore some aspects of Mr. Anderson's experience further before concluding the deposition.\nLine 28, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: No objection. Please proceed, Mr. Thompson.\nLine 29, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, you mentioned feeling unsure about the specific complaint process at\nLine 30, 19:01:37: Acme. Did you take any steps to learn more about it after your meeting with your supervisor?\nLine 31, 19:01:37: Witness: No, I didn't feel comfortable approaching my supervisor again after their dismissive response.\nLine 32, 19:01:37: Additionally, I recall the employee handbook being quite lengthy, and finding specific information about\nLine 33, 19:01:37: the complaint process proved difficult at the time.\n--- End of Page 5 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 6 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: You mentioned a colleague, Sarah Lopez, who voiced concerns about gender bias. Did\nLine 2, 19:01:37: you ever speak to her directly about her experience and the alleged retaliation she faced?\nLine 3, 19:01:37: Witness: Briefly, yes. We expressed our mutual frustrations and the feeling of being undervalued within\nLine 4, 19:01:37: the department. However, we were both hesitant to pursue any formal complaints due to the\nLine 5, 19:01:37: aforementioned concerns about the company culture and potential retaliation.\nLine 6, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Did you ever discuss the issue of lack of promotion opportunities with any other\nLine 7, 19:01:37: colleagues, particularly women in the marketing department?\nLine 8, 19:01:37: Witness: Not directly. While there were a few women colleagues in the department, none of them were\nLine 9, 19:01:37: in senior positions. The general environment discouraged open communication about potentially\nLine 10, 19:01:37: sensitive topics like discrimination.\nLine 11, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Thompson, I object to leading the witness. Can you rephrase your question and allow\nLine 12, 19:01:37: Mr. Anderson to answer in his own words?\nLine 13, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Apologies, Ms. Garcia. Mr. Anderson, to clarify, did you have any informal conversations\nLine 14, 19:01:37: with other colleagues about your concerns regarding promotion opportunities or potential gender bias\nLine 15, 19:01:37: within the marketing department at Acme?\nLine 16, 19:01:37: Witness: There weren't any specific discussions about promotions or bias, but the general atmosphere\nLine 17, 19:01:37: around the lack of female representation in senior positions was a frequent topic of quiet observation\nLine 18, 19:01:37: amongst some female colleagues. We felt implicit pressure to work harder and prove ourselves more\nLine 19, 19:01:37: than our male colleagues, but reaching leadership positions seemed like an increasingly distant\nLine 20, 19:01:37: prospect.\nLine 21, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you elaborate on what kind of \"pressure\" you felt, and was there any\nLine 22, 19:01:37: specific instance or behavior from colleagues or superiors that made you feel this way?\nLine 23, 19:01:37: Summary\nLine 24, 19:01:37: In the concluding segment, Mr. Anderson expresses hope that his experience can contribute to a more\nLine 25, 19:01:37: inclusive work environment at Acme. Mr. Thompson then delves deeper into specific aspects of Mr.\nLine 26, 19:01:37: Anderson's experience:\nLine 27, 19:01:37: Complaint process: Mr. Anderson cites discomfort following his supervisor's reaction and difficulty\nLine 28, 19:01:37: navigating the lengthy employee handbook as reasons for not seeking further information.\nLine 29, 19:01:37: Colleague's experience: He mentions briefly discussing his frustrations and concerns with Sarah Lopez\nLine 30, 19:01:37: but clarifies their shared hesitation to pursue formal complaints due to company culture concerns.\nLine 31, 19:01:37: Promotion opportunities and gender bias: He explains the lack of open communication about these\nLine 32, 19:01:37: issues and feeling unspoken pressure due to the absence of women in senior positions, though no\nLine 33, 19:01:37: specific discussions on bias occurred.\nLine 34, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia objects to a leading question about bias, and Mr. Thompson rephrases, allowing Mr.\nLine 35, 19:01:37: Anderson to clarify further. He explains the silent observation among female colleagues of the lack of\n--- End of Page 6 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 7 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:37: female leadership and the perceived need to overachieve compared to male colleagues. Ms. Garcia\nLine 2, 19:01:37: requests further details about the pressure felt by Mr. Anderson.\nLine 3, 19:01:37: Deposition\nLine 4, 19:01:37: Witness: It wasn't any direct confrontation or statement, but more of a subtle feeling arising from\nLine 5, 19:01:37: observing the lack of female representation in leadership roles combined with certain comments about\nLine 6, 19:01:37: needing to \"work harder\" or \"prove myself\" despite my consistent positive performance reviews.\nLine 7, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Thank you, Mr. Anderson. These are valuable insights. Do you have any further\nLine 8, 19:01:37: questions, Ms. Garcia?\nLine 9, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: (after reviewing her notes) I have a few follow-up questions for clarification. However, due\nLine 10, 19:01:37: to the time constraints, I would like to schedule a follow-up session at your earliest convenience, Mr.\nLine 11, 19:01:37: Thompson, to continue exploring specific details and potential evidence.\nLine 12, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: No objection. Mr. Anderson, are you available for a follow-up session within the next\nLine 13, 19:01:37: week?\nLine 14, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, I am available. Please let me know the details when you've scheduled it\nLine 15, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, since our last session, have you had any time to review Acme\nLine 16, 19:01:37: Corporation's employee handbook pertaining to the complaint process for potential discrimination?\nLine 17, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, I have.\nLine 18, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Can you briefly describe the steps outlined in the handbook for filing a complaint based\nLine 19, 19:01:37: on potential discrimination?\nLine 20, 19:01:37: Witness: The handbook mentioned employees could submit a written complaint to the Human\nLine 21, 19:01:37: Resources department or verbally report it to an HR representative or any manager. However, specific\nLine 22, 19:01:37: details about the investigation process or resolution options were quite vague.\nLine 23, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, did the employee handbook specify who constitutes a \"manager\" authorized\nLine 24, 19:01:37: to receive such initial verbal complaints?\nLine 25, 19:01:37: Witness: No, it didn't provide any specific details about which managers were included in that definition\nLine 26, 19:01:37: or if all managers were authorized to receive such reports.\nLine 27, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, you previously mentioned frustration with receiving similar design\nLine 28, 19:01:37: concepts to yours being chosen over your own work while working at Acme. Do you still have copies of\nLine 29, 19:01:37: these original design concepts and the final versions ultimately used?\nLine 30, 19:01:37: Witness: Unfortunately, I didn't retain individual copies of every design iteration. However, I did\nLine 31, 19:01:37: maintain some preliminary sketches and digital drafts from several projects, including the one discussed\nLine 32, 19:01:37: earlier related to the 2023 product launch campaign.\nLine 33, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Would you be willing to provide these materials as potential evidence in this case?\nLine 34, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, I can bring them to the next session.\n--- End of Page 7 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 8 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, are you aware of other colleagues who may have retained copies of their\nLine 2, 19:01:37: rejected design projects or drafts during their employment at Acme?\nLine 3, 19:01:37: Witness: I'm not certain, but I remember several colleagues raising concerns about the inconsistent\nLine 4, 19:01:37: feedback and selection process for design concepts. It's possible some of them might have kept records\nLine 5, 19:01:37: for their own reference.\nLine 6, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: We will look into that possibility. Mr. Anderson, during your time at Acme, did you ever\nLine 7, 19:01:37: meet or hear about any employees who filed official complaints based on experiencing discrimination?\nLine 8, 19:01:37: Witness: Not officially. As mentioned earlier, there was an underlying lack of transparency and open\nLine 9, 19:01:37: communication around potentially sensitive topics like discrimination. Therefore, it was difficult to know\nLine 10, 19:01:37: for sure.\nLine 11, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, did you receive any additional training or workshops related to diversity and\nLine 12, 19:01:37: inclusion since leaving Acme Corporation?\nLine 13, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, my current employer offers comprehensive training programs and workshops regarding\nLine 14, 19:01:37: diversity and inclusion as part of their ongoing commitment to a fair and equitable work environment.\nLine 15, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Do you find these additional training programs and the overall work environment at\nLine 16, 19:01:37: your current company to be beneficial compared to your experience at Acme?\nLine 17, 19:01:37: Witness: Absolutely. The focus on creating a safe space for open communication, valuing diverse\nLine 18, 19:01:37: perspectives, and providing equal opportunities for growth has been incredibly positive and\nLine 19, 19:01:37: empowering.\nLine 20, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: No further questions at this time.\nLine 21, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, as mentioned previously, we would like you to bring copies of the design\nLine 22, 19:01:37: materials you retained for the next session. Additionally, I may reach out to inquire about potential\nLine 23, 19:01:37: colleagues who might have kept similar records. Is that alright?\nLine 24, 19:01:37: Witness: That's perfectly fine. Please let me know if you need anything else in the meantime.\nLine 25, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, one final question before we adjourn. You mentioned feeling hesitant to\nLine 26, 19:01:37: bring up your concerns to your supervisor after their dismissive response. Did their reaction specifically\nLine 27, 19:01:37: mention any consequences of raising the potential bias issue?\nLine 28, 19:01:37: Witness: Not directly. There wasn't an explicit threat of any sort. However, their dismissive tone and the\nLine 29, 19:01:37: implication that my concerns weren't valid created an atmosphere where I felt further discussion would\nLine 30, 19:01:37: be futile and potentially disadvantageous.\nLine 31, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Objection, speculation about the witness's interpretation of a supervisor's tone is not based\nLine 32, 19:01:37: on facts.\nLine 33, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Reframing, Mr. Anderson. How did your supervisor's response make you feel about the\nLine 34, 19:01:37: potential consequences of reporting your concerns?\n--- End of Page 8 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 9 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:38: Witness: Their response discouraged me and made me feel unheard. It conveyed the impression that my\nLine 2, 19:01:38: concerns about potential bias wouldn't be taken seriously and could potentially hinder my career\nLine 3, 19:01:38: progression within the company.\nLine 4, 19:01:38: Summary\nLine 5, 19:01:38: The concluding segment addresses further details and sets the stage for a follow-up session:\nLine 6, 19:01:38: Complaint process: Mr. Anderson reviews the handbook and describes the outlined steps for filing a\nLine 7, 19:01:38: complaint, noting the vagueness regarding investigation and resolution. Ms. Garcia highlights the lack of\nLine 8, 19:01:38: clarity on who qualifies as a \"manager\" authorized to receive initial verbal reports.\nLine 9, 19:01:38: Design concepts: Mr. Anderson clarifies he still possesses some preliminary sketches and drafts,\nLine 10, 19:01:38: including those from the 2023 product launch, and agrees to provide them as potential evidence. Mr.\nLine 11, 19:01:38: Thompson expresses interest in exploring the possibility of other colleagues retaining similar materials.\nLine 12, 19:01:38: Official complaints: Mr. Anderson reiterates the lack of knowledge about any official discrimination\nLine 13, 19:01:38: complaints at Acme due to the previously mentioned culture of secrecy.\nLine 14, 19:01:38: Current company: Mr. Anderson confirms receiving additional diversity and inclusion training at his\nLine 15, 19:01:38: current company. He emphasizes the positive aspects of his new work environment, highlighting open\nLine 16, 19:01:38: communication, valuing diverse perspectives, and equal opportunities, contrasting it with his experience\nLine 17, 19:01:38: at Acme.\nLine 18, 19:01:38: Follow-up: Both parties agree to a follow-up session. Mr. Thompson clarifies his intention to request the\nLine 19, 19:01:38: design materials and potentially contact other colleagues. Ms. Garcia objects to the witness's\nLine 20, 19:01:38: interpretation of his supervisor's tone, leading Mr. Thompson to rephrase the question, to which Mr.\nLine 21, 19:01:38: Anderson reiterates feeling discouraged and unheard, fearing his concerns wouldn't be taken seriously\nLine 22, 19:01:38: and could hinder his career.\nLine 23, 19:01:38: Deposition\nLine 24, 19:01:38: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Thompson, I believe we've covered the essential topics for today. However, as these are\nLine 25, 19:01:38: complex claims, I would appreciate the opportunity to review the transcript and potentially ask further\nLine 26, 19:01:38: questions at a future session, should any need arise.\nLine 27, 19:01:38: Mr. Thompson: No objection. Mr. Anderson, as Ms. Garcia mentioned, we appreciate your willingness to\nLine 28, 19:01:38: cooperate and provide additional materials. We will be in touch to schedule a follow-up session if\nLine 29, 19:01:38: needed.\nLine 30, 19:01:38: Witness: Understood.\nLine 31, 19:01:38: Summary\nLine 32, 19:01:38: The deposition concludes with Ms. Garcia expressing a desire to review the transcript and potentially\nLine 33, 19:01:38: ask further questions in a future session if needed. Mr. Thompson agrees, and both thank Mr. Anderson\nLine 34, 19:01:38: for his cooperation and willingness to provide additional materials. Mr. Anderson acknowledges their\nLine 35, 19:01:38: communication and awaits further information regarding a potential follow-up session.\n--- End of Page 9 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 10 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:38: Deposition\nLine 2, 19:01:38: MILLER: A driver is obligated to pay attention to the road and yield to other drivers when required. Let\nLine 3, 19:01:38: me take you back to what happened on April 20th, 2022. The Defendant, who was an attorney for the\nLine 4, 19:01:38: IRS, was driving her usual route to work. She drove down Annapolis Road to take a left onto another\nLine 5, 19:01:38: road.\nLine 6, 19:01:38: (Could we have the next slide, please?) She was driving down this road\u2026 can everyone see this? She\nLine 7, 19:01:38: stopped at a light on a clear day. While stopped, she reached down to find her parking pass.\nLine 8, 19:01:38: DEFENSE LAWYER: May we approach?\nLine 9, 19:01:38: THE COURT: Yes.\nLine 10, 19:01:38: BENCH CONFERENCE\nLine 11, 19:01:38: (Bench Conference begins \u2013 10:26:39m.)\nLine 12, 19:01:38: (The parties approach the bench for a discussion.)\nLine 13, 19:01:38: THE COURT: By court ruling, liability has been established. The focus of this case is only on damages. I\nLine 14, 19:01:38: understand why we\u2019re discussing these details, but it\u2019s about damages.\nLine 15, 19:01:38: MILLER: I\u2019m setting the scene for the accident because her damages are part of the accident narrative.\nLine 16, 19:01:38: DEFENSE LAWYER: We\u2019re only discussing the fact that an accident happened and a person was injured.\nLine 17, 19:01:38: The details about reaching and negligence seem to be evidence of liability.\nLine 18, 19:01:38: THE COURT: I understand. It\u2019s your opening statement, so I\u2019ll give you some leeway.\nLine 19, 19:01:38: MILLER: I\u2019m just providing context. I\u2019ll be getting into the damages soon.\nLine 20, 19:01:38: THE COURT: Alright.\nLine 21, 19:01:38: (Bench Conference concluded \u2013 10:27:32 m.)\nLine 22, 19:01:38: (The parties return to their places.)\nLine 23, 19:01:38: MILLER: The Defendant heard a horn beep and took a left turn. She didn\u2019t see the Plaintiff, who had the\nLine 24, 19:01:38: right of way, coming from the opposite direction. Due to the collision, the Plaintiff\u2019s ankle was broken\nLine 25, 19:01:38: and required surgery.\nLine 26, 19:01:38: Take a look at these images. The first one shows her ankle before surgery, the second one after surgery.\nLine 27, 19:01:38: Today, she still has 15 screws and three plates in her ankle. She will never be able to run again and\nLine 28, 19:01:38: standing for extended periods of time is difficult.\nLine 29, 19:01:38: We\u2019ve brought this case before you because of the harm caused to the Plaintiff. We needed to agree\nLine 30, 19:01:38: that the Defendant was at fault for the accident, which she has accepted. We also had to understand the\nLine 31, 19:01:38: extent and implications of the Plaintiff\u2019s damages, not just the initial injury and surgery, but also its long-\nLine 32, 19:01:38: term impact on her life.\nLine 33, 19:01:38: To do this, we spoke to her doctors, her husband, her friends, and even her employer. One of her\nLine 34, 19:01:38: doctors is going to talk to you.\n--- End of Page 10 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 11 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:38: This is the guy to see if something awful like this is going to happen to your ankle. He received an Ivy\nLine 2, 19:01:38: League education and, at one point, was the chief of foot and ankle orthopedic injuries at Johns\nLine 3, 19:01:38: Hopkins. He consults for the Baltimore Orioles. His resume, I want to say, is as long as your arm, but it\u2019s\nLine 4, 19:01:38: actually a lot longer than that.\nLine 5, 19:01:38: We\u2019re going to bring him to talk to you guys, in a very 2023 way. It\u2019s going to be by videotape, so his\nLine 6, 19:01:38: testimony will be by videotape, but it holds the same force as if it was at trial, and he came here to see\nLine 7, 19:01:38: us. And, of course, my partner Laura Zois and the defense attorney had an opportunity to ask him\nLine 8, 19:01:38: questions.\nLine 9, 19:01:38: He\u2019s going to tell you she still has 15 screws and three plates in her ankle holding everything together.\nLine 10, 19:01:38: The problem with that is that it creates a breeding ground for arthritis, and this 33-year-old woman\nLine 11, 19:01:38: already has the signs of arthritis. At some point, she\u2019s going to need what\u2019s called a fusion, which will\nLine 12, 19:01:38: stabilize her ankle. The bad news is, you can\u2019t move it once it locks, so you no longer have the ability to\nLine 13, 19:01:38: bend.\nLine 14, 19:01:38: This trial is about the harms and losses that she has suffered and endured as the result of this accident.\nLine 15, 19:01:38: This is not a case about sympathy. You should not award her damages because you feel sorry for her.\nLine 16, 19:01:38: You\u2019re going to hear about how the accident has impacted her professional and personal life.\nLine 17, 19:01:38: At the time of the crash, they were a very young family. They were an energetic family. This is an active\nLine 18, 19:01:38: family with four kids doing everything you can imagine, Six Flags, the park. They would run together.\nLine 19, 19:01:38: They played basketball together. They traveled everywhere, New York, Baltimore, Washington, DC. They\nLine 20, 19:01:38: were just a very active family.\nLine 21, 19:01:38: And she also had a vibrant social life. She was a hairstylist, and she loved that job. It was her social outlet\nLine 22, 19:01:38: beside her kids. She would do the church choir every Wednesday, and still found times to go out and see\nLine 23, 19:01:38: her family. She\u2019s still fighting with her family, but it\u2019s hard.\nLine 24, 19:01:38: She can\u2019t work as a hairstylist anymore. So what did she do? She went back to school to the University\nLine 25, 19:01:38: of Maryland. She\u2019s working, getting very close to getting her degree. She\u2019s still fighting. She has four kids\nLine 26, 19:01:38: they\u2019re chasing around.\nLine 27, 19:01:38: Let\u2019s go back and talk about how it ended up. Let\u2019s talk about the accident. She had this awful crash and\nLine 28, 19:01:38: needed emergency surgery where they put in these screws. She had a nine-month-old baby, along with\nLine 29, 19:01:38: three other kids. She and the two girls, the younger ones, went to live with her mom. Her mom took\nLine 30, 19:01:38: care of her and the girls, while her husband took care of the other kids.\nLine 31, 19:01:38: This has been a massive disruption to their lives. The accident has completely changed her life, and it\u2019s\nLine 32, 19:01:38: reflected in every facet of her day-to-day. Her job, her family life, her hobbies, everything she used to\nLine 33, 19:01:38: take pleasure in has been impacted in one way or another. And the evidence in this case will show these\nLine 34, 19:01:38: changes are likely to persist for the rest of her life.\nLine 35, 19:01:38: We ask you to consider the totality of these changes, the persistent harm and loss she\u2019s suffered and\nLine 36, 19:01:38: will continue to suffer, as a direct result of the accident. We ask you to consider these when coming to a\nLine 37, 19:01:38: decision in this case.\n--- End of Page 11 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 12 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:38: This accident, however, led to an upheaval in their lives. About a month after the accident, she managed\nLine 2, 19:01:38: to return home with the kids. Her mother, an FDA employee, took three months off work to care for her,\nLine 3, 19:01:38: her daughter, and her grandchildren. The accident wreaked havoc on their lives.\nLine 4, 19:01:38: She endured six months of rigorous physical therapy and another operation. While it was painful and\nLine 5, 19:01:38: difficult, the effort was worthwhile as it improved her condition, especially her ankle, though we wish\nLine 6, 19:01:38: she had recovered more.\nLine 7, 19:01:38: As we delve into this case, it\u2019s about the harm and losses experienced. We will ask you to make amends\nLine 8, 19:01:38: where possible and provide compensation for the irreparable harm. The damages can be categorized\nLine 9, 19:01:38: into three parts: her medical bills, the post-accident trauma suffered by her and her family, and the pain\nLine 10, 19:01:38: she will endure for the expected next 45 years of her life.\nLine 11, 19:01:38: She was a spontaneous person, fond of making impromptu plans like going to Virginia Beach over the\nLine 12, 19:01:38: weekend or heading to the park. Now, every activity revolves around her ability to reach there, her\nLine 13, 19:01:38: mobility, and whether she can tolerate the pain during the trip. This situation has affected her and her\nLine 14, 19:01:38: four kids, as well as her husband.\nLine 15, 19:01:38: The court wants to clarify that the evidence and testimonies from the witness stand are what will\nLine 16, 19:01:38: control your deliberations. Opening statements and closing arguments of lawyers do not constitute\nLine 17, 19:01:38: evidence.\nLine 18, 19:01:38: This case is not just about the suffering of their children or her husband. It\u2019s about the impact of their\nLine 19, 19:01:38: suffering on her. We will ask you to consider an amount that may seem high at the beginning. But we\nLine 20, 19:01:38: believe that after hearing all the evidence, you\u2019ll find it to be a fair compensation for her losses and\nLine 21, 19:01:38: harm. The amount we suggest is $1.1 million.\nLine 22, 19:01:38: Defense Opening Statement\nLine 23, 19:01:38: Regarding the defendant, they acknowledge the responsibility for the accident and that it was their\nLine 24, 19:01:38: fault. The case is for you to determine the appropriate damages. The injury is severe, and they ask for an\nLine 25, 19:01:38: extraordinary amount of compensation.\nLine 26, 19:01:38: She broke her ankle, which was repaired surgically with plates and screws. There was a second surgery\nLine 27, 19:01:38: due to loosening of the screws, which were then removed. She attended physical therapy, which\nLine 28, 19:01:38: improved her ability to move her ankle. Whether she will need surgery in the future is uncertain.\nLine 29, 19:01:38: The past medical expenses are around $36,505, which we don\u2019t contest. Her lost wages due to the\nLine 30, 19:01:38: accident are around $3,400 to $3,500. These are not the focal points of this case. The main issue is the\nLine 31, 19:01:38: amount to be awarded for non-economic damages, for which we request something fair, reasonable,\nLine 32, 19:01:38: and sensible.\nLine 33, 19:01:38: Thank you for your time and attention, and we hope to conclude this case promptly.\nLine 34, 19:01:38: Testimony of Victim\u2019s Husband\nLine 35, 19:01:38: Mr. Miller: Good morning. Can I have your address?\nLine 36, 19:01:38: SJ: Certainly.\nLine 37, 19:01:38: Mr. Miller: How long have you lived at that address?\n--- End of Page 12 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 13 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: SJ: I bought the house in 2003, so it\u2019s been approximately ten years.\nLine 2, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Who lives there with you?\nLine 3, 19:01:39: SJ: My wife, and our four children.\nLine 4, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Can you tell the jury how old your children are and their names?\nLine 5, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes. My children are 13, and the others are\u2026\nLine 6, 19:01:39: The Honorable Judge: Please continue.\nLine 7, 19:01:39: SJ: \u2026five, and three.\nLine 8, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: I understand. And for some background, what do you do for a living?\nLine 9, 19:01:39: SJ: I\u2019m currently the general manager at Oreck Clean Home Center.\nLine 10, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: And where are these locations?\nLine 11, 19:01:39: SJ: We have six locations in Maryland and Virginia.\nLine 12, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: What are your responsibilities at work?\nLine 13, 19:01:39: SJ: I oversee all six stores and manage one of them.\nLine 14, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Can you describe your work schedule?\nLine 15, 19:01:39: SJ: I work Monday through Saturday, from 10:00 am to 7:00 pm. Often, I work seven days a week which\nLine 16, 19:01:39: means working on Sundays from 12:00 pm to 5:00 pm.\nLine 17, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: How do you feel about those hours?\nLine 18, 19:01:39: SJ: They are long, but I need to work to support my family.\nLine 19, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: How long have you known your wife?\nLine 20, 19:01:39: SJ: I met her in 1993, she was my sister\u2019s best friend.\nLine 21, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: You mean your wife was your sister\u2019s best friend?\nLine 22, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes, I apologize for the confusion. She was indeed my sister\u2019s best friend.\nLine 23, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Let\u2019s move to another topic. Do you remember the car accident your wife was in 2022?\nLine 24, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes, I do.\nLine 25, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Prior to the accident, can you describe your household?\nLine 26, 19:01:39: SJ: Our household was what I would consider the perfect life. My wife and children were happy and\nLine 27, 19:01:39: always engaged in activities. We used to take vacations and attend family reunions.\nLine 28, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Was your wife a spontaneous person or a planner?\nLine 29, 19:01:39: SJ: She was more spontaneous, always ready to take on new activities.\n--- End of Page 13 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 14 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Could you describe her for the jury?\nLine 2, 19:01:39: SJ: She is always happy, loves socializing and helping people. She attended choir rehearsal, Bible study\nLine 3, 19:01:39: every week, and also took care of our four children.\nLine 4, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: What was her job at the time of the crash?\nLine 5, 19:01:39: SJ: She was the assistant manager of a hair salon.\nLine 6, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Did she enjoy her work?\nLine 7, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes, she loved her work. It was part of her identity.\nLine 8, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Did your wife\u2019s demeanor change after the car accident?\nLine 9, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes, after the accident everything changed. Our family life and activity level changed significantly. She\nLine 10, 19:01:39: used to take the children to sporting events and practice basketball. Now, she can\u2019t do these activities.\nLine 11, 19:01:39: She no longer goes on family vacations. My two older sons call her \u201cboring\u201d now because of her reduced\nLine 12, 19:01:39: activity level. The accident has restricted her capabilities and as a result, she can\u2019t even do simple tasks\nLine 13, 19:01:39: like carrying laundry baskets or standing up to cook. Our family life has changed drastically since the\nLine 14, 19:01:39: accident.\nLine 15, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Has your wife gone back to work since the accident?\nLine 16, 19:01:39: SJ: She tried to help a friend out a couple of months ago at her hair salon, but it ended with her in a lot\nLine 17, 19:01:39: of pain due to the swelling in her ankle.\nLine 18, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: I have here a picture you received from your wife. Is this the picture she sent you?\nLine 19, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Can you tell us how your wife\u2019s personal social life has been affected since the crash?\nLine 20, 19:01:39: SJ: Her social life has indeed changed significantly. Before the accident, she would regularly go out with\nLine 21, 19:01:39: friends, engage in dancing, and other social activities. However, the constant pain and discomfort after\nLine 22, 19:01:39: the crash have made such activities impossible. Her social life is definitely not the same as before.\nLine 23, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: You mentioned earlier about her job. Was she able to resume work post the crash?\nLine 24, 19:01:39: SJ: She attempted to return to work, but the persistent pain made it unmanageable, particularly the\nLine 25, 19:01:39: long-standing hours. Eventually, she was forced to leave her job.\nLine 26, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: How has this situation impacted your family\u2019s finances?\nLine 27, 19:01:39: SJ: The impact has been substantial. She held the position of an assistant manager at a hair salon,\nLine 28, 19:01:39: bringing in a significant income. Now, with my single income, managing expenses for our four children\nLine 29, 19:01:39: and her medical bills has been strenuous.\nLine 30, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Besides the financial struggle, can you share how your relationship with your wife has\nLine 31, 19:01:39: evolved post the accident?\nLine 32, 19:01:39: SJ: Our relationship has undeniably been affected. She isn\u2019t the same person she was before the crash.\nLine 33, 19:01:39: Her constant pain and fatigue, coupled with frustration, have been hard on both of us.\nLine 34, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: And your children? How have they been coping with all these changes?\n--- End of Page 14 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 15 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: SJ: Our children have had to make significant adjustments. They miss the mother they had before the\nLine 2, 19:01:39: crash, not understanding why she can\u2019t engage in the activities she used to do with them. My older\nLine 3, 19:01:39: sons, in particular, have had to step up, assisting more with household chores. It\u2019s been a lot for them\nLine 4, 19:01:39: too.\nLine 5, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Finally, could you share your hopes for your wife\u2019s future?\nLine 6, 19:01:39: SJ: My biggest hope is for her to find relief from her pain and regain some semblance of normalcy. She\nLine 7, 19:01:39: deserves to live her life, not just endure it. It\u2019s challenging to see such a wonderful person go through\nLine 8, 19:01:39: this. We are taking each day as it comes, hoping for a better future.\nLine 9, 19:01:39: Defense Attorney Cross Examination of Victim\u2019s Husband\nLine 10, 19:01:39: Q: Regarding the foot stretching exercises, you assist her with those?\nLine 11, 19:01:39: A: Yes, I do.\nLine 12, 19:01:39: Q: Looking through her medical records, I noticed there\u2019s mention of an exercise bike at home. Do you\nLine 13, 19:01:39: have one?\nLine 14, 19:01:39: A: Indeed, we do have an exercise bike at home.\nLine 15, 19:01:39: Q: Did she frequently use the exercise bike, especially post-accident?\nLine 16, 19:01:39: A: Initially, during her therapy, they had her try riding the exercise bike.\nLine 17, 19:01:39: Q: Can you tell us what kind of exercises she did at home after the accident?\nLine 18, 19:01:39: A: She was given a chart with exercises, and I\u2019ve been helping her to flex her foot in both directions to\nLine 19, 19:01:39: try and loosen it up.\nLine 20, 19:01:39: Q: How long did this routine last?\nLine 21, 19:01:39: A: Actually, I still assist her with the foot exercises every night.\nLine 22, 19:01:39: Q: So you assist her based on the instructions from the chart?\nLine 23, 19:01:39: A: Not directly from the chart, but I\u2019ve learned the correct angles and try to flex her foot every night for\nLine 24, 19:01:39: her comfort and to aid her sleep.\nLine 25, 19:01:39: Q: Does she drive?\nLine 26, 19:01:39: A: Yes, she does.\nLine 27, 19:01:39: Q: Prior to the accident, she was employed full time?\nLine 28, 19:01:39: A: Yes, that\u2019s correct.\nLine 29, 19:01:39: Q: The jury was informed initially that she was also pursuing a degree?\nLine 30, 19:01:39: A: Yes, she was attending the University of Maryland.\nLine 31, 19:01:39: Q: Did she commute to the university?\nLine 32, 19:01:39: A: At certain points she did, but due to our four children, she primarily takes her classes online now.\n--- End of Page 15 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 16 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: Q: How close is she to obtaining her degree?\nLine 2, 19:01:39: A: She\u2019s expected to graduate within the next year.\nLine 3, 19:01:39: Court: Any redirect?\nLine 4, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: No further questions, Your Honor.\nLine 5, 19:01:39: Court: Thank you, sir, you may step down. Proceed with your next witness.\nLine 6, 19:01:39: (Witness excused \u2013 11:56:56 a.m.)\nLine 7, 19:01:39: Summary\nLine 8, 19:01:39: The excerpt showcases the husband of the accident victim testifying about the impact of the accident on\nLine 9, 19:01:39: their family life. Here's a concise summary:\nLine 10, 19:01:39: Before the accident:\nLine 11, 19:01:39: The family was described as happy and engaged in activities, including vacations and family reunions.\nLine 12, 19:01:39: The wife was spontaneous, sociable, and involved in various activities like choir, bible study, and caring\nLine 13, 19:01:39: for their four children.\nLine 14, 19:01:39: She enjoyed her work as an assistant manager at a hair salon.\nLine 15, 19:01:39: After the accident:\nLine 16, 19:01:39: The family life and activity level significantly changed.\nLine 17, 19:01:39: The wife's physical limitations restrict her participation in activities like taking children to events, playing\nLine 18, 19:01:39: sports, or going on family vacations.\nLine 19, 19:01:39: Her reduced activity has even affected how their children perceive her, calling her \"boring.\"\nLine 20, 19:01:39: She struggles with simple tasks like carrying laundry or cooking.\nLine 21, 19:01:39: Impact on the family:\nLine 22, 19:01:39: The wife attempted but couldn't return to work due to pain and difficulty managing long hours.\nLine 23, 19:01:39: The financial burden increased significantly with a single income supporting the family and medical bills.\nLine 24, 19:01:39: The strain on the wife due to pain and frustration has impacted their relationship.\nLine 25, 19:01:39: The children have had to adjust and take on more responsibilities, missing their previous active mother.\nLine 26, 19:01:39: Husband's hope for the future:\nLine 27, 19:01:39: He desires for his wife to find pain relief and regain normalcy in her life.\nLine 28, 19:01:39: Defense cross-examination:\nLine 29, 19:01:39: The husband assists with the wife's foot exercises based on instructions from a chart.\nLine 30, 19:01:39: She still drives and is pursuing a degree online while caring for their children.\n--- End of Page 16 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 17 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: She expects to graduate within the next year.\n--- End of Page 17 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 1 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:53: Deposition:\nLine 2, 19:20:53: Court Reporter: Please state your name for the record.\nLine 3, 19:20:53: Witness: Sarah Miller.\nLine 4, 19:20:53: Court Reporter: And how do you spell your last name, Ms. Miller?\nLine 5, 19:20:53: Witness: M-I-L-L-E-R.\nLine 6, 19:20:53: Mr. Brown: Ms. Miller, are you aware that today's proceedings are a legal deposition and that you are\nLine 7, 19:20:53: under oath to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?\nLine 8, 19:20:53: Witness: Yes, I am aware.\nLine 9, 19:20:53: Mr. Brown: Thank you. Ms. Miller, were you present at the intersection of Main Street and Maple\nLine 10, 19:20:53: Avenue on July 15th, 2023, at approximately 3:00 pm?\nLine 11, 19:20:53: Witness: Yes, I was. I was waiting at the red light on Maple Avenue, southbound, facing east.\nLine 12, 19:20:53: Mr. Brown: Did you witness any accidents at that intersection at that time?\nLine 13, 19:20:53: Witness: Yes, I did. I saw a car traveling westbound on Main Street, which I believe was a blue sedan, run\nLine 14, 19:20:53: the red light and collide with a car traveling northbound on Maple Avenue, which I believe was a white\nLine 15, 19:20:53: SUV.\nLine 16, 19:20:53: Mr. Brown: Can you describe the collision in more detail?\nLine 17, 19:20:53: Witness: The blue sedan seemed to be traveling at a high speed and didn't slow down or attempt to stop\nLine 18, 19:20:53: at the red light. It hit the white SUV directly on the driver's side. The impact was quite forceful, and both\nLine 19, 19:20:53: cars spun around significantly.\nLine 20, 19:20:53: Mr. Lee: Ms. Miller, you mentioned the blue sedan was traveling at a high speed. How fast would you\nLine 21, 19:20:53: say it was going?\nLine 22, 19:20:53: Witness: It's difficult to say for sure, but it appeared to be going much faster than the posted speed\nLine 23, 19:20:53: limit, which is 35 miles per hour.\nLine 24, 19:20:53: Mr. Lee: Did you see the driver of either vehicle at any point?\nLine 25, 19:20:53: Witness: No, I didn't.\nLine 26, 19:20:53: Mr. Brown: Ms. Miller, did you notice anything unusual about the driver's behavior in the blue sedan\nLine 27, 19:20:53: before the accident?\nLine 28, 19:20:53: Witness: It's hard to say. Everything happened very quickly, but the car did seem to be swerving slightly\nLine 29, 19:20:53: just before the collision.\nLine 30, 19:20:53: Mr. Lee: Ms. Miller, did you call the police or offer assistance to anyone involved in the accident?\nLine 31, 19:20:53: Witness: Yes, I immediately called 911 and stayed at the scene until the police arrived.\nLine 32, 19:20:53: Mr. Brown: Did you speak to anyone else who may have witnessed the accident?\n--- End of Page 1 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 2 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:53: Witness: Yes, I exchanged information with another driver who was stopped next to me on Maple\nLine 2, 19:20:53: Avenue at the time.\nLine 3, 19:20:53: Mr. Lee: Do you recall the make and model of the other vehicle that you spoke to?\nLine 4, 19:20:53: Witness: I believe it was a silver Toyota Camry, but I'm not entirely sure.\nLine 5, 19:20:53: Mr. Brown: That's all my questions at this time.\nLine 6, 19:20:53: Mr. Lee: I have no further questions\nLine 7, 19:20:53: Summary:\nLine 8, 19:20:53: The excerpt is from a legal deposition of Michael Anderson, who is under oath to tell the truth. Mr.\nLine 9, 19:20:53: Anderson confirms his employment at Acme Corporation as a graphic designer and details his job duties.\nLine 10, 19:20:53: He also confirms receiving positive performance reviews and never facing disciplinary actions. The\nLine 11, 19:20:53: excerpt ends with a question about witnessing or experiencing any discriminatory situations at Acme.\n--- End of Page 2 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 3 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:53: Deposition:\nLine 2, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Objection, that question calls for legal conclusions from the witness.\nLine 3, 19:20:53: Mr. Thompson: Withdrawn. Mr. Anderson, please describe any specific incidents or instances at Acme\nLine 4, 19:20:53: that involved your [protected category].\nLine 5, 19:20:53: Witness: There were several things that made me feel uncomfortable. During meetings, colleagues often\nLine 6, 19:20:53: talked over me or dismissed my ideas, particularly when compared to my younger male colleagues. I\nLine 7, 19:20:53: was also consistently passed over for promotions despite having experience and qualifications\nLine 8, 19:20:53: comparable to others who got promoted.\nLine 9, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you be specific about which colleagues treated you this way and provide\nLine 10, 19:20:53: specific examples of situations where these incidents occurred?\nLine 11, 19:20:53: Witness: One specific example would be the marketing campaign for the new product launch in 2023. I\nLine 12, 19:20:53: put significant effort into developing design concepts, but they were ultimately disregarded without any\nLine 13, 19:20:53: explanation. My male colleague's design, which was very similar to mine, was ultimately chosen.\nLine 14, 19:20:53: Mr. Thompson: Did you ever report any of these incidents to your supervisor or anyone else at Acme?\nLine 15, 19:20:53: Witness: I once mentioned feeling undervalued to my supervisor, but they brushed it off, suggesting I\nLine 16, 19:20:53: needed to \"work harder to prove myself.\" I wasn't comfortable bringing it up further after that.\nLine 17, 19:20:53: Mr. Thompson: Did you decide to leave Acme voluntarily, or were you terminated?\nLine 18, 19:20:53: Witness: When they announced another promotion I felt qualified for, but was once again passed over\nLine 19, 19:20:53: without explanation, I decided it was time to find a new position where I felt valued and respected.\nLine 20, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you confirm that your decision to leave Acme was solely based on not\nLine 21, 19:20:53: receiving the promotion, and not due to other factors like job performance or personal reasons?\nLine 22, 19:20:53: Witness: To the best of my knowledge, yes. It became clear to me that further advancement\nLine 23, 19:20:53: opportunities within the company were unlikely.\nLine 24, 19:20:53: Mr. Thompson: That's all my questions at this time.\nLine 25, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, during your time at Acme, did you ever receive any negative performance\nLine 26, 19:20:53: reviews or warnings related to your work performance?\nLine 27, 19:20:53: Witness: No, as mentioned before, my performance reviews were always positive.\nLine 28, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Did you ever attend any diversity and inclusion training offered by Acme during your\nLine 29, 19:20:53: employment?\nLine 30, 19:20:53: Witness: I did participate in the mandatory online training modules, but there weren't any specific\nLine 31, 19:20:53: training sessions related to addressing or reporting potentially discriminatory situations within the\nLine 32, 19:20:53: company.\nLine 33, 19:20:53: Summary\n--- End of Page 3 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 4 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:53: Michael Anderson details specific incidents supporting his feeling of being undervalued based on his\nLine 2, 19:20:53: protected category. He describes colleagues disregarding his ideas and being passed over for\nLine 3, 19:20:53: promotions despite comparable qualifications. He provides a specific example from the 2023 product\nLine 4, 19:20:53: launch where his design was overlooked in favor of a male colleague's similar work. He mentions\nLine 5, 19:20:53: mentioning his concerns to his supervisor but being discouraged from pursuing them. He clarifies his\nLine 6, 19:20:53: decision to leave Acme was due to the lack of advancement opportunities, not performance or personal\nLine 7, 19:20:53: reasons. Ms. Garcia then establishes that Mr. Anderson's performance was consistently good and that\nLine 8, 19:20:53: he participated in available diversity training while at Acme, though specific training for addressing\nLine 9, 19:20:53: potential discrimination was absent.\nLine 10, 19:20:53: Deposition:\nLine 11, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, are you aware of Acme's anti-discrimination policy or how complaints of\nLine 12, 19:20:53: discrimination are addressed within the company?\nLine 13, 19:20:53: Witness: I reviewed the employee handbook, which did explain the existence of an anti-discrimination\nLine 14, 19:20:53: policy. However, I was unsure of the specific complaint process at the time\nLine 15, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you elaborate on why you felt apprehensive about bringing up these\nLine 16, 19:20:53: incidents to your supervisor despite feeling uncomfortable and undervalued?\nLine 17, 19:20:53: Witness: Honestly, there were a few reasons. Firstly, as I mentioned, when I did hint at feeling\nLine 18, 19:20:53: undervalued to my supervisor, their dismissive response discouraged me from further discussions. It\nLine 19, 19:20:53: seemed like they weren't receptive to hearing about any potential issues.\nLine 20, 19:20:53: Secondly, there was a general company culture that made me hesitant to speak up. Younger male\nLine 21, 19:20:53: colleagues often dominated conversations and presentations, and there weren't many women in senior\nLine 22, 19:20:53: positions within the marketing department. It felt like my voice wouldn't be heard or even worse, that\nLine 23, 19:20:53: bringing forward complaints might lead to retaliation or hinder my career further.\nLine 24, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Did you notice any specific instances of retaliation against other employees who may have\nLine 25, 19:20:53: raised complaints or concerns about work environment issues?\nLine 26, 19:20:53: Witness: While I can't say for sure, there was one colleague, Sarah Lopez, who openly challenged gender\nLine 27, 19:20:53: bias during a department meeting but was subsequently given less desirable project assignments\nLine 28, 19:20:53: compared to her male colleagues. This incident definitely reinforced my concerns about potentially\nLine 29, 19:20:53: facing a similar situation.**\nLine 30, 19:20:53: Mr. Thompson: Objection, speculation about an unrelated case is irrelevant to the present matter.\nLine 31, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Withdrawn. Mr. Anderson, did you ever discuss your concerns about potential bias or lack of\nLine 32, 19:20:53: promotion opportunities with any human resources personnel at Acme?\nLine 33, 19:20:53: Witness: No, I didn't. As I mentioned before, the lack of clarity on the specific complaint process\nLine 34, 19:20:53: combined with the overall culture discouraged me from pursuing that route.\nLine 35, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, since leaving Acme, have you sought employment elsewhere?\n--- End of Page 4 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 5 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:54: Witness: Yes, I am currently employed at a different company and feel much more valued and respected\nLine 2, 19:20:54: in my current role. The work environment is significantly more inclusive, and I regularly receive positive\nLine 3, 19:20:54: feedback and opportunities for professional development.\nLine 4, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, how has your experience at Acme impacted you personally and\nLine 5, 19:20:54: professionally?\nLine 6, 19:20:54: Witness: It was definitely a frustrating and discouraging experience. It felt like my hard work and\nLine 7, 19:20:54: qualifications weren't being recognized fairly, leading to some self-doubt and a sense of being\nLine 8, 19:20:54: undervalued. However, finding a new and positive work environment has helped me rebuild my\nLine 9, 19:20:54: confidence and refocus on my career goals.\nLine 10, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: I have no further questions.\nLine 11, 19:20:54: Summary\nLine 12, 19:20:54: This segment explores Mr. Anderson's reasons for not formally complaining despite feeling undervalued.\nLine 13, 19:20:54: He reiterates his supervisor's dismissive response and the perceived lack of receptiveness within the\nLine 14, 19:20:54: company culture. He describes a specific instance where a colleague who challenged gender bias faced\nLine 15, 19:20:54: negative consequences, reinforcing his fear of retaliation. He clarifies that he didn't pursue HR due to\nLine 16, 19:20:54: unclear procedures and the discouraging company culture. Finally, he highlights his positive experience\nLine 17, 19:20:54: at a new company, emphasizing feelings of value, inclusion, and professional growth in contrast to his\nLine 18, 19:20:54: experience at Acme. He concludes by acknowledging the frustration and self-doubt from Acme but also\nLine 19, 19:20:54: the positive impact of finding a supportive work environment.\nLine 20, 19:20:54: Deposition\nLine 21, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: I have one final question. Mr. Anderson, is there anything else you would like to add\nLine 22, 19:20:54: regarding your experience at Acme Corporation?\nLine 23, 19:20:54: Witness: Just that I hope by sharing my story, it can contribute to fostering a more diverse and inclusive\nLine 24, 19:20:54: work environment at Acme for future employees. Everyone deserves to feel valued and respected in\nLine 25, 19:20:54: their workplace, regardless of their [protected category].\nLine 26, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Interesting point, Mr. Anderson. Ms. Garcia, while you have no further questions, I'd like\nLine 27, 19:20:54: to explore some aspects of Mr. Anderson's experience further before concluding the deposition.\nLine 28, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: No objection. Please proceed, Mr. Thompson.\nLine 29, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, you mentioned feeling unsure about the specific complaint process at\nLine 30, 19:20:54: Acme. Did you take any steps to learn more about it after your meeting with your supervisor?\nLine 31, 19:20:54: Witness: No, I didn't feel comfortable approaching my supervisor again after their dismissive response.\nLine 32, 19:20:54: Additionally, I recall the employee handbook being quite lengthy, and finding specific information about\nLine 33, 19:20:54: the complaint process proved difficult at the time.\n--- End of Page 5 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 6 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: You mentioned a colleague, Sarah Lopez, who voiced concerns about gender bias. Did\nLine 2, 19:20:54: you ever speak to her directly about her experience and the alleged retaliation she faced?\nLine 3, 19:20:54: Witness: Briefly, yes. We expressed our mutual frustrations and the feeling of being undervalued within\nLine 4, 19:20:54: the department. However, we were both hesitant to pursue any formal complaints due to the\nLine 5, 19:20:54: aforementioned concerns about the company culture and potential retaliation.\nLine 6, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Did you ever discuss the issue of lack of promotion opportunities with any other\nLine 7, 19:20:54: colleagues, particularly women in the marketing department?\nLine 8, 19:20:54: Witness: Not directly. While there were a few women colleagues in the department, none of them were\nLine 9, 19:20:54: in senior positions. The general environment discouraged open communication about potentially\nLine 10, 19:20:54: sensitive topics like discrimination.\nLine 11, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Thompson, I object to leading the witness. Can you rephrase your question and allow\nLine 12, 19:20:54: Mr. Anderson to answer in his own words?\nLine 13, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Apologies, Ms. Garcia. Mr. Anderson, to clarify, did you have any informal conversations\nLine 14, 19:20:54: with other colleagues about your concerns regarding promotion opportunities or potential gender bias\nLine 15, 19:20:54: within the marketing department at Acme?\nLine 16, 19:20:54: Witness: There weren't any specific discussions about promotions or bias, but the general atmosphere\nLine 17, 19:20:54: around the lack of female representation in senior positions was a frequent topic of quiet observation\nLine 18, 19:20:54: amongst some female colleagues. We felt implicit pressure to work harder and prove ourselves more\nLine 19, 19:20:54: than our male colleagues, but reaching leadership positions seemed like an increasingly distant\nLine 20, 19:20:54: prospect.\nLine 21, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you elaborate on what kind of \"pressure\" you felt, and was there any\nLine 22, 19:20:54: specific instance or behavior from colleagues or superiors that made you feel this way?\nLine 23, 19:20:54: Summary\nLine 24, 19:20:54: In the concluding segment, Mr. Anderson expresses hope that his experience can contribute to a more\nLine 25, 19:20:54: inclusive work environment at Acme. Mr. Thompson then delves deeper into specific aspects of Mr.\nLine 26, 19:20:54: Anderson's experience:\nLine 27, 19:20:54: Complaint process: Mr. Anderson cites discomfort following his supervisor's reaction and difficulty\nLine 28, 19:20:54: navigating the lengthy employee handbook as reasons for not seeking further information.\nLine 29, 19:20:54: Colleague's experience: He mentions briefly discussing his frustrations and concerns with Sarah Lopez\nLine 30, 19:20:54: but clarifies their shared hesitation to pursue formal complaints due to company culture concerns.\nLine 31, 19:20:54: Promotion opportunities and gender bias: He explains the lack of open communication about these\nLine 32, 19:20:54: issues and feeling unspoken pressure due to the absence of women in senior positions, though no\nLine 33, 19:20:54: specific discussions on bias occurred.\nLine 34, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia objects to a leading question about bias, and Mr. Thompson rephrases, allowing Mr.\nLine 35, 19:20:54: Anderson to clarify further. He explains the silent observation among female colleagues of the lack of\n--- End of Page 6 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 7 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:54: female leadership and the perceived need to overachieve compared to male colleagues. Ms. Garcia\nLine 2, 19:20:54: requests further details about the pressure felt by Mr. Anderson.\nLine 3, 19:20:54: Deposition\nLine 4, 19:20:54: Witness: It wasn't any direct confrontation or statement, but more of a subtle feeling arising from\nLine 5, 19:20:54: observing the lack of female representation in leadership roles combined with certain comments about\nLine 6, 19:20:54: needing to \"work harder\" or \"prove myself\" despite my consistent positive performance reviews.\nLine 7, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Thank you, Mr. Anderson. These are valuable insights. Do you have any further\nLine 8, 19:20:54: questions, Ms. Garcia?\nLine 9, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: (after reviewing her notes) I have a few follow-up questions for clarification. However, due\nLine 10, 19:20:54: to the time constraints, I would like to schedule a follow-up session at your earliest convenience, Mr.\nLine 11, 19:20:54: Thompson, to continue exploring specific details and potential evidence.\nLine 12, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: No objection. Mr. Anderson, are you available for a follow-up session within the next\nLine 13, 19:20:54: week?\nLine 14, 19:20:54: Witness: Yes, I am available. Please let me know the details when you've scheduled it\nLine 15, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, since our last session, have you had any time to review Acme\nLine 16, 19:20:54: Corporation's employee handbook pertaining to the complaint process for potential discrimination?\nLine 17, 19:20:54: Witness: Yes, I have.\nLine 18, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Can you briefly describe the steps outlined in the handbook for filing a complaint based\nLine 19, 19:20:54: on potential discrimination?\nLine 20, 19:20:54: Witness: The handbook mentioned employees could submit a written complaint to the Human\nLine 21, 19:20:54: Resources department or verbally report it to an HR representative or any manager. However, specific\nLine 22, 19:20:54: details about the investigation process or resolution options were quite vague.\nLine 23, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, did the employee handbook specify who constitutes a \"manager\" authorized\nLine 24, 19:20:54: to receive such initial verbal complaints?\nLine 25, 19:20:54: Witness: No, it didn't provide any specific details about which managers were included in that definition\nLine 26, 19:20:54: or if all managers were authorized to receive such reports.\nLine 27, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, you previously mentioned frustration with receiving similar design\nLine 28, 19:20:54: concepts to yours being chosen over your own work while working at Acme. Do you still have copies of\nLine 29, 19:20:54: these original design concepts and the final versions ultimately used?\nLine 30, 19:20:54: Witness: Unfortunately, I didn't retain individual copies of every design iteration. However, I did\nLine 31, 19:20:54: maintain some preliminary sketches and digital drafts from several projects, including the one discussed\nLine 32, 19:20:54: earlier related to the 2023 product launch campaign.\nLine 33, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Would you be willing to provide these materials as potential evidence in this case?\nLine 34, 19:20:54: Witness: Yes, I can bring them to the next session.\n--- End of Page 7 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 8 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, are you aware of other colleagues who may have retained copies of their\nLine 2, 19:20:54: rejected design projects or drafts during their employment at Acme?\nLine 3, 19:20:54: Witness: I'm not certain, but I remember several colleagues raising concerns about the inconsistent\nLine 4, 19:20:54: feedback and selection process for design concepts. It's possible some of them might have kept records\nLine 5, 19:20:54: for their own reference.\nLine 6, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: We will look into that possibility. Mr. Anderson, during your time at Acme, did you ever\nLine 7, 19:20:54: meet or hear about any employees who filed official complaints based on experiencing discrimination?\nLine 8, 19:20:54: Witness: Not officially. As mentioned earlier, there was an underlying lack of transparency and open\nLine 9, 19:20:54: communication around potentially sensitive topics like discrimination. Therefore, it was difficult to know\nLine 10, 19:20:54: for sure.\nLine 11, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, did you receive any additional training or workshops related to diversity and\nLine 12, 19:20:54: inclusion since leaving Acme Corporation?\nLine 13, 19:20:54: Witness: Yes, my current employer offers comprehensive training programs and workshops regarding\nLine 14, 19:20:54: diversity and inclusion as part of their ongoing commitment to a fair and equitable work environment.\nLine 15, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Do you find these additional training programs and the overall work environment at\nLine 16, 19:20:54: your current company to be beneficial compared to your experience at Acme?\nLine 17, 19:20:54: Witness: Absolutely. The focus on creating a safe space for open communication, valuing diverse\nLine 18, 19:20:54: perspectives, and providing equal opportunities for growth has been incredibly positive and\nLine 19, 19:20:54: empowering.\nLine 20, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: No further questions at this time.\nLine 21, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, as mentioned previously, we would like you to bring copies of the design\nLine 22, 19:20:54: materials you retained for the next session. Additionally, I may reach out to inquire about potential\nLine 23, 19:20:54: colleagues who might have kept similar records. Is that alright?\nLine 24, 19:20:54: Witness: That's perfectly fine. Please let me know if you need anything else in the meantime.\nLine 25, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, one final question before we adjourn. You mentioned feeling hesitant to\nLine 26, 19:20:54: bring up your concerns to your supervisor after their dismissive response. Did their reaction specifically\nLine 27, 19:20:54: mention any consequences of raising the potential bias issue?\nLine 28, 19:20:54: Witness: Not directly. There wasn't an explicit threat of any sort. However, their dismissive tone and the\nLine 29, 19:20:54: implication that my concerns weren't valid created an atmosphere where I felt further discussion would\nLine 30, 19:20:54: be futile and potentially disadvantageous.\nLine 31, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: Objection, speculation about the witness's interpretation of a supervisor's tone is not based\nLine 32, 19:20:54: on facts.\nLine 33, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Reframing, Mr. Anderson. How did your supervisor's response make you feel about the\nLine 34, 19:20:54: potential consequences of reporting your concerns?\n--- End of Page 8 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 9 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:55: Witness: Their response discouraged me and made me feel unheard. It conveyed the impression that my\nLine 2, 19:20:55: concerns about potential bias wouldn't be taken seriously and could potentially hinder my career\nLine 3, 19:20:55: progression within the company.\nLine 4, 19:20:55: Summary\nLine 5, 19:20:55: The concluding segment addresses further details and sets the stage for a follow-up session:\nLine 6, 19:20:55: Complaint process: Mr. Anderson reviews the handbook and describes the outlined steps for filing a\nLine 7, 19:20:55: complaint, noting the vagueness regarding investigation and resolution. Ms. Garcia highlights the lack of\nLine 8, 19:20:55: clarity on who qualifies as a \"manager\" authorized to receive initial verbal reports.\nLine 9, 19:20:55: Design concepts: Mr. Anderson clarifies he still possesses some preliminary sketches and drafts,\nLine 10, 19:20:55: including those from the 2023 product launch, and agrees to provide them as potential evidence. Mr.\nLine 11, 19:20:55: Thompson expresses interest in exploring the possibility of other colleagues retaining similar materials.\nLine 12, 19:20:55: Official complaints: Mr. Anderson reiterates the lack of knowledge about any official discrimination\nLine 13, 19:20:55: complaints at Acme due to the previously mentioned culture of secrecy.\nLine 14, 19:20:55: Current company: Mr. Anderson confirms receiving additional diversity and inclusion training at his\nLine 15, 19:20:55: current company. He emphasizes the positive aspects of his new work environment, highlighting open\nLine 16, 19:20:55: communication, valuing diverse perspectives, and equal opportunities, contrasting it with his experience\nLine 17, 19:20:55: at Acme.\nLine 18, 19:20:55: Follow-up: Both parties agree to a follow-up session. Mr. Thompson clarifies his intention to request the\nLine 19, 19:20:55: design materials and potentially contact other colleagues. Ms. Garcia objects to the witness's\nLine 20, 19:20:55: interpretation of his supervisor's tone, leading Mr. Thompson to rephrase the question, to which Mr.\nLine 21, 19:20:55: Anderson reiterates feeling discouraged and unheard, fearing his concerns wouldn't be taken seriously\nLine 22, 19:20:55: and could hinder his career.\nLine 23, 19:20:55: Deposition\nLine 24, 19:20:55: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Thompson, I believe we've covered the essential topics for today. However, as these are\nLine 25, 19:20:55: complex claims, I would appreciate the opportunity to review the transcript and potentially ask further\nLine 26, 19:20:55: questions at a future session, should any need arise.\nLine 27, 19:20:55: Mr. Thompson: No objection. Mr. Anderson, as Ms. Garcia mentioned, we appreciate your willingness to\nLine 28, 19:20:55: cooperate and provide additional materials. We will be in touch to schedule a follow-up session if\nLine 29, 19:20:55: needed.\nLine 30, 19:20:55: Witness: Understood.\nLine 31, 19:20:55: Summary\nLine 32, 19:20:55: The deposition concludes with Ms. Garcia expressing a desire to review the transcript and potentially\nLine 33, 19:20:55: ask further questions in a future session if needed. Mr. Thompson agrees, and both thank Mr. Anderson\nLine 34, 19:20:55: for his cooperation and willingness to provide additional materials. Mr. Anderson acknowledges their\nLine 35, 19:20:55: communication and awaits further information regarding a potential follow-up session.\n--- End of Page 9 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 10 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:55: Deposition\nLine 2, 19:20:55: MILLER: A driver is obligated to pay attention to the road and yield to other drivers when required. Let\nLine 3, 19:20:55: me take you back to what happened on April 20th, 2022. The Defendant, who was an attorney for the\nLine 4, 19:20:55: IRS, was driving her usual route to work. She drove down Annapolis Road to take a left onto another\nLine 5, 19:20:55: road.\nLine 6, 19:20:55: (Could we have the next slide, please?) She was driving down this road\u2026 can everyone see this? She\nLine 7, 19:20:55: stopped at a light on a clear day. While stopped, she reached down to find her parking pass.\nLine 8, 19:20:55: DEFENSE LAWYER: May we approach?\nLine 9, 19:20:55: THE COURT: Yes.\nLine 10, 19:20:55: BENCH CONFERENCE\nLine 11, 19:20:55: (Bench Conference begins \u2013 10:26:39m.)\nLine 12, 19:20:55: (The parties approach the bench for a discussion.)\nLine 13, 19:20:55: THE COURT: By court ruling, liability has been established. The focus of this case is only on damages. I\nLine 14, 19:20:55: understand why we\u2019re discussing these details, but it\u2019s about damages.\nLine 15, 19:20:55: MILLER: I\u2019m setting the scene for the accident because her damages are part of the accident narrative.\nLine 16, 19:20:55: DEFENSE LAWYER: We\u2019re only discussing the fact that an accident happened and a person was injured.\nLine 17, 19:20:55: The details about reaching and negligence seem to be evidence of liability.\nLine 18, 19:20:55: THE COURT: I understand. It\u2019s your opening statement, so I\u2019ll give you some leeway.\nLine 19, 19:20:55: MILLER: I\u2019m just providing context. I\u2019ll be getting into the damages soon.\nLine 20, 19:20:55: THE COURT: Alright.\nLine 21, 19:20:55: (Bench Conference concluded \u2013 10:27:32 m.)\nLine 22, 19:20:55: (The parties return to their places.)\nLine 23, 19:20:55: MILLER: The Defendant heard a horn beep and took a left turn. She didn\u2019t see the Plaintiff, who had the\nLine 24, 19:20:55: right of way, coming from the opposite direction. Due to the collision, the Plaintiff\u2019s ankle was broken\nLine 25, 19:20:55: and required surgery.\nLine 26, 19:20:55: Take a look at these images. The first one shows her ankle before surgery, the second one after surgery.\nLine 27, 19:20:55: Today, she still has 15 screws and three plates in her ankle. She will never be able to run again and\nLine 28, 19:20:55: standing for extended periods of time is difficult.\nLine 29, 19:20:55: We\u2019ve brought this case before you because of the harm caused to the Plaintiff. We needed to agree\nLine 30, 19:20:55: that the Defendant was at fault for the accident, which she has accepted. We also had to understand the\nLine 31, 19:20:55: extent and implications of the Plaintiff\u2019s damages, not just the initial injury and surgery, but also its long-\nLine 32, 19:20:55: term impact on her life.\nLine 33, 19:20:55: To do this, we spoke to her doctors, her husband, her friends, and even her employer. One of her\nLine 34, 19:20:55: doctors is going to talk to you.\n--- End of Page 10 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 11 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:55: This is the guy to see if something awful like this is going to happen to your ankle. He received an Ivy\nLine 2, 19:20:55: League education and, at one point, was the chief of foot and ankle orthopedic injuries at Johns\nLine 3, 19:20:55: Hopkins. He consults for the Baltimore Orioles. His resume, I want to say, is as long as your arm, but it\u2019s\nLine 4, 19:20:55: actually a lot longer than that.\nLine 5, 19:20:55: We\u2019re going to bring him to talk to you guys, in a very 2023 way. It\u2019s going to be by videotape, so his\nLine 6, 19:20:55: testimony will be by videotape, but it holds the same force as if it was at trial, and he came here to see\nLine 7, 19:20:55: us. And, of course, my partner Laura Zois and the defense attorney had an opportunity to ask him\nLine 8, 19:20:55: questions.\nLine 9, 19:20:55: He\u2019s going to tell you she still has 15 screws and three plates in her ankle holding everything together.\nLine 10, 19:20:55: The problem with that is that it creates a breeding ground for arthritis, and this 33-year-old woman\nLine 11, 19:20:55: already has the signs of arthritis. At some point, she\u2019s going to need what\u2019s called a fusion, which will\nLine 12, 19:20:55: stabilize her ankle. The bad news is, you can\u2019t move it once it locks, so you no longer have the ability to\nLine 13, 19:20:55: bend.\nLine 14, 19:20:55: This trial is about the harms and losses that she has suffered and endured as the result of this accident.\nLine 15, 19:20:55: This is not a case about sympathy. You should not award her damages because you feel sorry for her.\nLine 16, 19:20:55: You\u2019re going to hear about how the accident has impacted her professional and personal life.\nLine 17, 19:20:55: At the time of the crash, they were a very young family. They were an energetic family. This is an active\nLine 18, 19:20:55: family with four kids doing everything you can imagine, Six Flags, the park. They would run together.\nLine 19, 19:20:55: They played basketball together. They traveled everywhere, New York, Baltimore, Washington, DC. They\nLine 20, 19:20:55: were just a very active family.\nLine 21, 19:20:55: And she also had a vibrant social life. She was a hairstylist, and she loved that job. It was her social outlet\nLine 22, 19:20:55: beside her kids. She would do the church choir every Wednesday, and still found times to go out and see\nLine 23, 19:20:55: her family. She\u2019s still fighting with her family, but it\u2019s hard.\nLine 24, 19:20:55: She can\u2019t work as a hairstylist anymore. So what did she do? She went back to school to the University\nLine 25, 19:20:55: of Maryland. She\u2019s working, getting very close to getting her degree. She\u2019s still fighting. She has four kids\nLine 26, 19:20:55: they\u2019re chasing around.\nLine 27, 19:20:55: Let\u2019s go back and talk about how it ended up. Let\u2019s talk about the accident. She had this awful crash and\nLine 28, 19:20:55: needed emergency surgery where they put in these screws. She had a nine-month-old baby, along with\nLine 29, 19:20:55: three other kids. She and the two girls, the younger ones, went to live with her mom. Her mom took\nLine 30, 19:20:55: care of her and the girls, while her husband took care of the other kids.\nLine 31, 19:20:55: This has been a massive disruption to their lives. The accident has completely changed her life, and it\u2019s\nLine 32, 19:20:55: reflected in every facet of her day-to-day. Her job, her family life, her hobbies, everything she used to\nLine 33, 19:20:55: take pleasure in has been impacted in one way or another. And the evidence in this case will show these\nLine 34, 19:20:55: changes are likely to persist for the rest of her life.\nLine 35, 19:20:55: We ask you to consider the totality of these changes, the persistent harm and loss she\u2019s suffered and\nLine 36, 19:20:55: will continue to suffer, as a direct result of the accident. We ask you to consider these when coming to a\nLine 37, 19:20:55: decision in this case.\n--- End of Page 11 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 12 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:55: This accident, however, led to an upheaval in their lives. About a month after the accident, she managed\nLine 2, 19:20:55: to return home with the kids. Her mother, an FDA employee, took three months off work to care for her,\nLine 3, 19:20:55: her daughter, and her grandchildren. The accident wreaked havoc on their lives.\nLine 4, 19:20:55: She endured six months of rigorous physical therapy and another operation. While it was painful and\nLine 5, 19:20:55: difficult, the effort was worthwhile as it improved her condition, especially her ankle, though we wish\nLine 6, 19:20:55: she had recovered more.\nLine 7, 19:20:55: As we delve into this case, it\u2019s about the harm and losses experienced. We will ask you to make amends\nLine 8, 19:20:55: where possible and provide compensation for the irreparable harm. The damages can be categorized\nLine 9, 19:20:55: into three parts: her medical bills, the post-accident trauma suffered by her and her family, and the pain\nLine 10, 19:20:55: she will endure for the expected next 45 years of her life.\nLine 11, 19:20:55: She was a spontaneous person, fond of making impromptu plans like going to Virginia Beach over the\nLine 12, 19:20:55: weekend or heading to the park. Now, every activity revolves around her ability to reach there, her\nLine 13, 19:20:55: mobility, and whether she can tolerate the pain during the trip. This situation has affected her and her\nLine 14, 19:20:55: four kids, as well as her husband.\nLine 15, 19:20:55: The court wants to clarify that the evidence and testimonies from the witness stand are what will\nLine 16, 19:20:55: control your deliberations. Opening statements and closing arguments of lawyers do not constitute\nLine 17, 19:20:55: evidence.\nLine 18, 19:20:55: This case is not just about the suffering of their children or her husband. It\u2019s about the impact of their\nLine 19, 19:20:55: suffering on her. We will ask you to consider an amount that may seem high at the beginning. But we\nLine 20, 19:20:55: believe that after hearing all the evidence, you\u2019ll find it to be a fair compensation for her losses and\nLine 21, 19:20:55: harm. The amount we suggest is $1.1 million.\nLine 22, 19:20:55: Defense Opening Statement\nLine 23, 19:20:55: Regarding the defendant, they acknowledge the responsibility for the accident and that it was their\nLine 24, 19:20:55: fault. The case is for you to determine the appropriate damages. The injury is severe, and they ask for an\nLine 25, 19:20:55: extraordinary amount of compensation.\nLine 26, 19:20:55: She broke her ankle, which was repaired surgically with plates and screws. There was a second surgery\nLine 27, 19:20:55: due to loosening of the screws, which were then removed. She attended physical therapy, which\nLine 28, 19:20:55: improved her ability to move her ankle. Whether she will need surgery in the future is uncertain.\nLine 29, 19:20:55: The past medical expenses are around $36,505, which we don\u2019t contest. Her lost wages due to the\nLine 30, 19:20:55: accident are around $3,400 to $3,500. These are not the focal points of this case. The main issue is the\nLine 31, 19:20:55: amount to be awarded for non-economic damages, for which we request something fair, reasonable,\nLine 32, 19:20:55: and sensible.\nLine 33, 19:20:55: Thank you for your time and attention, and we hope to conclude this case promptly.\nLine 34, 19:20:55: Testimony of Victim\u2019s Husband\nLine 35, 19:20:55: Mr. Miller: Good morning. Can I have your address?\nLine 36, 19:20:55: SJ: Certainly.\nLine 37, 19:20:55: Mr. Miller: How long have you lived at that address?\n--- End of Page 12 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 13 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:56: SJ: I bought the house in 2003, so it\u2019s been approximately ten years.\nLine 2, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Who lives there with you?\nLine 3, 19:20:56: SJ: My wife, and our four children.\nLine 4, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Can you tell the jury how old your children are and their names?\nLine 5, 19:20:56: SJ: Yes. My children are 13, and the others are\u2026\nLine 6, 19:20:56: The Honorable Judge: Please continue.\nLine 7, 19:20:56: SJ: \u2026five, and three.\nLine 8, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: I understand. And for some background, what do you do for a living?\nLine 9, 19:20:56: SJ: I\u2019m currently the general manager at Oreck Clean Home Center.\nLine 10, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: And where are these locations?\nLine 11, 19:20:56: SJ: We have six locations in Maryland and Virginia.\nLine 12, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: What are your responsibilities at work?\nLine 13, 19:20:56: SJ: I oversee all six stores and manage one of them.\nLine 14, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Can you describe your work schedule?\nLine 15, 19:20:56: SJ: I work Monday through Saturday, from 10:00 am to 7:00 pm. Often, I work seven days a week which\nLine 16, 19:20:56: means working on Sundays from 12:00 pm to 5:00 pm.\nLine 17, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: How do you feel about those hours?\nLine 18, 19:20:56: SJ: They are long, but I need to work to support my family.\nLine 19, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: How long have you known your wife?\nLine 20, 19:20:56: SJ: I met her in 1993, she was my sister\u2019s best friend.\nLine 21, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: You mean your wife was your sister\u2019s best friend?\nLine 22, 19:20:56: SJ: Yes, I apologize for the confusion. She was indeed my sister\u2019s best friend.\nLine 23, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Let\u2019s move to another topic. Do you remember the car accident your wife was in 2022?\nLine 24, 19:20:56: SJ: Yes, I do.\nLine 25, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Prior to the accident, can you describe your household?\nLine 26, 19:20:56: SJ: Our household was what I would consider the perfect life. My wife and children were happy and\nLine 27, 19:20:56: always engaged in activities. We used to take vacations and attend family reunions.\nLine 28, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Was your wife a spontaneous person or a planner?\nLine 29, 19:20:56: SJ: She was more spontaneous, always ready to take on new activities.\n--- End of Page 13 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 14 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Could you describe her for the jury?\nLine 2, 19:20:56: SJ: She is always happy, loves socializing and helping people. She attended choir rehearsal, Bible study\nLine 3, 19:20:56: every week, and also took care of our four children.\nLine 4, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: What was her job at the time of the crash?\nLine 5, 19:20:56: SJ: She was the assistant manager of a hair salon.\nLine 6, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Did she enjoy her work?\nLine 7, 19:20:56: SJ: Yes, she loved her work. It was part of her identity.\nLine 8, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Did your wife\u2019s demeanor change after the car accident?\nLine 9, 19:20:56: SJ: Yes, after the accident everything changed. Our family life and activity level changed significantly. She\nLine 10, 19:20:56: used to take the children to sporting events and practice basketball. Now, she can\u2019t do these activities.\nLine 11, 19:20:56: She no longer goes on family vacations. My two older sons call her \u201cboring\u201d now because of her reduced\nLine 12, 19:20:56: activity level. The accident has restricted her capabilities and as a result, she can\u2019t even do simple tasks\nLine 13, 19:20:56: like carrying laundry baskets or standing up to cook. Our family life has changed drastically since the\nLine 14, 19:20:56: accident.\nLine 15, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Has your wife gone back to work since the accident?\nLine 16, 19:20:56: SJ: She tried to help a friend out a couple of months ago at her hair salon, but it ended with her in a lot\nLine 17, 19:20:56: of pain due to the swelling in her ankle.\nLine 18, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: I have here a picture you received from your wife. Is this the picture she sent you?\nLine 19, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Can you tell us how your wife\u2019s personal social life has been affected since the crash?\nLine 20, 19:20:56: SJ: Her social life has indeed changed significantly. Before the accident, she would regularly go out with\nLine 21, 19:20:56: friends, engage in dancing, and other social activities. However, the constant pain and discomfort after\nLine 22, 19:20:56: the crash have made such activities impossible. Her social life is definitely not the same as before.\nLine 23, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: You mentioned earlier about her job. Was she able to resume work post the crash?\nLine 24, 19:20:56: SJ: She attempted to return to work, but the persistent pain made it unmanageable, particularly the\nLine 25, 19:20:56: long-standing hours. Eventually, she was forced to leave her job.\nLine 26, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: How has this situation impacted your family\u2019s finances?\nLine 27, 19:20:56: SJ: The impact has been substantial. She held the position of an assistant manager at a hair salon,\nLine 28, 19:20:56: bringing in a significant income. Now, with my single income, managing expenses for our four children\nLine 29, 19:20:56: and her medical bills has been strenuous.\nLine 30, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Besides the financial struggle, can you share how your relationship with your wife has\nLine 31, 19:20:56: evolved post the accident?\nLine 32, 19:20:56: SJ: Our relationship has undeniably been affected. She isn\u2019t the same person she was before the crash.\nLine 33, 19:20:56: Her constant pain and fatigue, coupled with frustration, have been hard on both of us.\nLine 34, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: And your children? How have they been coping with all these changes?\n--- End of Page 14 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 15 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:56: SJ: Our children have had to make significant adjustments. They miss the mother they had before the\nLine 2, 19:20:56: crash, not understanding why she can\u2019t engage in the activities she used to do with them. My older\nLine 3, 19:20:56: sons, in particular, have had to step up, assisting more with household chores. It\u2019s been a lot for them\nLine 4, 19:20:56: too.\nLine 5, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Finally, could you share your hopes for your wife\u2019s future?\nLine 6, 19:20:56: SJ: My biggest hope is for her to find relief from her pain and regain some semblance of normalcy. She\nLine 7, 19:20:56: deserves to live her life, not just endure it. It\u2019s challenging to see such a wonderful person go through\nLine 8, 19:20:56: this. We are taking each day as it comes, hoping for a better future.\nLine 9, 19:20:56: Defense Attorney Cross Examination of Victim\u2019s Husband\nLine 10, 19:20:56: Q: Regarding the foot stretching exercises, you assist her with those?\nLine 11, 19:20:56: A: Yes, I do.\nLine 12, 19:20:56: Q: Looking through her medical records, I noticed there\u2019s mention of an exercise bike at home.

Ms. Miller, were you present at the intersection of Main Street and Maple\nLine 10, 19:01:36: Avenue on July 15th, 2023, at approximately 3:00 pm?\nLine 11, 19:01:36: Witness: Yes, I was. I was waiting at the red light on Maple Avenue, southbound, facing east.\nLine 12, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: Did you witness any accidents at that intersection at that time?\nLine 13, 19:01:36: Witness: Yes, I did. I saw a car traveling westbound on Main Street, which I believe was a blue sedan, run\nLine 14, 19:01:36: the red light and collide with a car traveling northbound on Maple Avenue, which I believe was a white\nLine 15, 19:01:36: SUV.\nLine 16, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: Can you describe the collision in more detail?\nLine 17, 19:01:36: Witness: The blue sedan seemed to be traveling at a high speed and didn't slow down or attempt to stop\nLine 18, 19:01:36: at the red light. It hit the white SUV directly on the driver's side. The impact was quite forceful, and both\nLine 19, 19:01:36: cars spun around significantly.\nLine 20, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: Ms. Miller, you mentioned the blue sedan was traveling at a high speed. How fast would you\nLine 21, 19:01:36: say it was going?\nLine 22, 19:01:36: Witness: It's difficult to say for sure, but it appeared to be going much faster than the posted speed\nLine 23, 19:01:36: limit, which is 35 miles per hour.\nLine 24, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: Did you see the driver of either vehicle at any point?\nLine 25, 19:01:36: Witness: No, I didn't.\nLine 26, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: Ms. Miller, did you notice anything unusual about the driver's behavior in the blue sedan\nLine 27, 19:01:36: before the accident?\nLine 28, 19:01:36: Witness: It's hard to say. Everything happened very quickly, but the car did seem to be swerving slightly\nLine 29, 19:01:36: just before the collision.\nLine 30, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: Ms. Miller, did you call the police or offer assistance to anyone involved in the accident?\nLine 31, 19:01:36: Witness: Yes, I immediately called 911 and stayed at the scene until the police arrived.\nLine 32, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: Did you speak to anyone else who may have witnessed the accident?\n--- End of Page 1 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 2 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:36: Witness: Yes, I exchanged information with another driver who was stopped next to me on Maple\nLine 2, 19:01:36: Avenue at the time.\nLine 3, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: Do you recall the make and model of the other vehicle that you spoke to?\nLine 4, 19:01:36: Witness: I believe it was a silver Toyota Camry, but I'm not entirely sure.\nLine 5, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: That's all my questions at this time.\nLine 6, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: I have no further questions\nLine 7, 19:01:36: Summary:\nLine 8, 19:01:36: The excerpt is from a legal deposition of Michael Anderson, who is under oath to tell the truth. Mr.\nLine 9, 19:01:36: Anderson confirms his employment at Acme Corporation as a graphic designer and details his job duties.\nLine 10, 19:01:36: He also confirms receiving positive performance reviews and never facing disciplinary actions. The\nLine 11, 19:01:36: excerpt ends with a question about witnessing or experiencing any discriminatory situations at Acme.\n--- End of Page 2 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 3 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:36: Deposition:\nLine 2, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Objection, that question calls for legal conclusions from the witness.\nLine 3, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: Withdrawn. Mr. Anderson, please describe any specific incidents or instances at Acme\nLine 4, 19:01:36: that involved your [protected category].\nLine 5, 19:01:36: Witness: There were several things that made me feel uncomfortable. During meetings, colleagues often\nLine 6, 19:01:36: talked over me or dismissed my ideas, particularly when compared to my younger male colleagues. I\nLine 7, 19:01:36: was also consistently passed over for promotions despite having experience and qualifications\nLine 8, 19:01:36: comparable to others who got promoted.\nLine 9, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you be specific about which colleagues treated you this way and provide\nLine 10, 19:01:36: specific examples of situations where these incidents occurred?\nLine 11, 19:01:36: Witness: One specific example would be the marketing campaign for the new product launch in 2023. I\nLine 12, 19:01:36: put significant effort into developing design concepts, but they were ultimately disregarded without any\nLine 13, 19:01:36: explanation. My male colleague's design, which was very similar to mine, was ultimately chosen.\nLine 14, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: Did you ever report any of these incidents to your supervisor or anyone else at Acme?\nLine 15, 19:01:36: Witness: I once mentioned feeling undervalued to my supervisor, but they brushed it off, suggesting I\nLine 16, 19:01:36: needed to \"work harder to prove myself.\" I wasn't comfortable bringing it up further after that.\nLine 17, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: Did you decide to leave Acme voluntarily, or were you terminated?\nLine 18, 19:01:36: Witness: When they announced another promotion I felt qualified for, but was once again passed over\nLine 19, 19:01:36: without explanation, I decided it was time to find a new position where I felt valued and respected.\nLine 20, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you confirm that your decision to leave Acme was solely based on not\nLine 21, 19:01:36: receiving the promotion, and not due to other factors like job performance or personal reasons?\nLine 22, 19:01:36: Witness: To the best of my knowledge, yes. It became clear to me that further advancement\nLine 23, 19:01:36: opportunities within the company were unlikely.\nLine 24, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: That's all my questions at this time.\nLine 25, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, during your time at Acme, did you ever receive any negative performance\nLine 26, 19:01:36: reviews or warnings related to your work performance?\nLine 27, 19:01:36: Witness: No, as mentioned before, my performance reviews were always positive.\nLine 28, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Did you ever attend any diversity and inclusion training offered by Acme during your\nLine 29, 19:01:36: employment?\nLine 30, 19:01:36: Witness: I did participate in the mandatory online training modules, but there weren't any specific\nLine 31, 19:01:36: training sessions related to addressing or reporting potentially discriminatory situations within the\nLine 32, 19:01:36: company.\nLine 33, 19:01:36: Summary\n--- End of Page 3 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 4 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:36: Michael Anderson details specific incidents supporting his feeling of being undervalued based on his\nLine 2, 19:01:36: protected category. He describes colleagues disregarding his ideas and being passed over for\nLine 3, 19:01:36: promotions despite comparable qualifications. He provides a specific example from the 2023 product\nLine 4, 19:01:36: launch where his design was overlooked in favor of a male colleague's similar work. He mentions\nLine 5, 19:01:36: mentioning his concerns to his supervisor but being discouraged from pursuing them. He clarifies his\nLine 6, 19:01:36: decision to leave Acme was due to the lack of advancement opportunities, not performance or personal\nLine 7, 19:01:36: reasons. Ms. Garcia then establishes that Mr. Anderson's performance was consistently good and that\nLine 8, 19:01:36: he participated in available diversity training while at Acme, though specific training for addressing\nLine 9, 19:01:36: potential discrimination was absent.\nLine 10, 19:01:36: Deposition:\nLine 11, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, are you aware of Acme's anti-discrimination policy or how complaints of\nLine 12, 19:01:36: discrimination are addressed within the company?\nLine 13, 19:01:36: Witness: I reviewed the employee handbook, which did explain the existence of an anti-discrimination\nLine 14, 19:01:36: policy. However, I was unsure of the specific complaint process at the time\nLine 15, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you elaborate on why you felt apprehensive about bringing up these\nLine 16, 19:01:36: incidents to your supervisor despite feeling uncomfortable and undervalued?\nLine 17, 19:01:36: Witness: Honestly, there were a few reasons. Firstly, as I mentioned, when I did hint at feeling\nLine 18, 19:01:36: undervalued to my supervisor, their dismissive response discouraged me from further discussions. It\nLine 19, 19:01:36: seemed like they weren't receptive to hearing about any potential issues.\nLine 20, 19:01:36: Secondly, there was a general company culture that made me hesitant to speak up. Younger male\nLine 21, 19:01:36: colleagues often dominated conversations and presentations, and there weren't many women in senior\nLine 22, 19:01:36: positions within the marketing department. It felt like my voice wouldn't be heard or even worse, that\nLine 23, 19:01:36: bringing forward complaints might lead to retaliation or hinder my career further.\nLine 24, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Did you notice any specific instances of retaliation against other employees who may have\nLine 25, 19:01:36: raised complaints or concerns about work environment issues?\nLine 26, 19:01:36: Witness: While I can't say for sure, there was one colleague, Sarah Lopez, who openly challenged gender\nLine 27, 19:01:36: bias during a department meeting but was subsequently given less desirable project assignments\nLine 28, 19:01:36: compared to her male colleagues. This incident definitely reinforced my concerns about potentially\nLine 29, 19:01:36: facing a similar situation.**\nLine 30, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: Objection, speculation about an unrelated case is irrelevant to the present matter.\nLine 31, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Withdrawn. Mr. Anderson, did you ever discuss your concerns about potential bias or lack of\nLine 32, 19:01:36: promotion opportunities with any human resources personnel at Acme?\nLine 33, 19:01:36: Witness: No, I didn't. As I mentioned before, the lack of clarity on the specific complaint process\nLine 34, 19:01:36: combined with the overall culture discouraged me from pursuing that route.\nLine 35, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, since leaving Acme, have you sought employment elsewhere?\n--- End of Page 4 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 5 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, I am currently employed at a different company and feel much more valued and respected\nLine 2, 19:01:37: in my current role. The work environment is significantly more inclusive, and I regularly receive positive\nLine 3, 19:01:37: feedback and opportunities for professional development.\nLine 4, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, how has your experience at Acme impacted you personally and\nLine 5, 19:01:37: professionally?\nLine 6, 19:01:37: Witness: It was definitely a frustrating and discouraging experience. It felt like my hard work and\nLine 7, 19:01:37: qualifications weren't being recognized fairly, leading to some self-doubt and a sense of being\nLine 8, 19:01:37: undervalued. However, finding a new and positive work environment has helped me rebuild my\nLine 9, 19:01:37: confidence and refocus on my career goals.\nLine 10, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: I have no further questions.\nLine 11, 19:01:37: Summary\nLine 12, 19:01:37: This segment explores Mr. Anderson's reasons for not formally complaining despite feeling undervalued.\nLine 13, 19:01:37: He reiterates his supervisor's dismissive response and the perceived lack of receptiveness within the\nLine 14, 19:01:37: company culture. He describes a specific instance where a colleague who challenged gender bias faced\nLine 15, 19:01:37: negative consequences, reinforcing his fear of retaliation. He clarifies that he didn't pursue HR due to\nLine 16, 19:01:37: unclear procedures and the discouraging company culture. Finally, he highlights his positive experience\nLine 17, 19:01:37: at a new company, emphasizing feelings of value, inclusion, and professional growth in contrast to his\nLine 18, 19:01:37: experience at Acme. He concludes by acknowledging the frustration and self-doubt from Acme but also\nLine 19, 19:01:37: the positive impact of finding a supportive work environment.\nLine 20, 19:01:37: Deposition\nLine 21, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: I have one final question. Mr. Anderson, is there anything else you would like to add\nLine 22, 19:01:37: regarding your experience at Acme Corporation?\nLine 23, 19:01:37: Witness: Just that I hope by sharing my story, it can contribute to fostering a more diverse and inclusive\nLine 24, 19:01:37: work environment at Acme for future employees. Everyone deserves to feel valued and respected in\nLine 25, 19:01:37: their workplace, regardless of their [protected category].\nLine 26, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Interesting point, Mr. Anderson. Ms. Garcia, while you have no further questions, I'd like\nLine 27, 19:01:37: to explore some aspects of Mr. Anderson's experience further before concluding the deposition.\nLine 28, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: No objection. Please proceed, Mr. Thompson.\nLine 29, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, you mentioned feeling unsure about the specific complaint process at\nLine 30, 19:01:37: Acme. Did you take any steps to learn more about it after your meeting with your supervisor?\nLine 31, 19:01:37: Witness: No, I didn't feel comfortable approaching my supervisor again after their dismissive response.\nLine 32, 19:01:37: Additionally, I recall the employee handbook being quite lengthy, and finding specific information about\nLine 33, 19:01:37: the complaint process proved difficult at the time.\n--- End of Page 5 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 6 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: You mentioned a colleague, Sarah Lopez, who voiced concerns about gender bias. Did\nLine 2, 19:01:37: you ever speak to her directly about her experience and the alleged retaliation she faced?\nLine 3, 19:01:37: Witness: Briefly, yes. We expressed our mutual frustrations and the feeling of being undervalued within\nLine 4, 19:01:37: the department. However, we were both hesitant to pursue any formal complaints due to the\nLine 5, 19:01:37: aforementioned concerns about the company culture and potential retaliation.\nLine 6, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Did you ever discuss the issue of lack of promotion opportunities with any other\nLine 7, 19:01:37: colleagues, particularly women in the marketing department?\nLine 8, 19:01:37: Witness: Not directly. While there were a few women colleagues in the department, none of them were\nLine 9, 19:01:37: in senior positions. The general environment discouraged open communication about potentially\nLine 10, 19:01:37: sensitive topics like discrimination.\nLine 11, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Thompson, I object to leading the witness. Can you rephrase your question and allow\nLine 12, 19:01:37: Mr. Anderson to answer in his own words?\nLine 13, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Apologies, Ms. Garcia. Mr. Anderson, to clarify, did you have any informal conversations\nLine 14, 19:01:37: with other colleagues about your concerns regarding promotion opportunities or potential gender bias\nLine 15, 19:01:37: within the marketing department at Acme?\nLine 16, 19:01:37: Witness: There weren't any specific discussions about promotions or bias, but the general atmosphere\nLine 17, 19:01:37: around the lack of female representation in senior positions was a frequent topic of quiet observation\nLine 18, 19:01:37: amongst some female colleagues. We felt implicit pressure to work harder and prove ourselves more\nLine 19, 19:01:37: than our male colleagues, but reaching leadership positions seemed like an increasingly distant\nLine 20, 19:01:37: prospect.\nLine 21, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you elaborate on what kind of \"pressure\" you felt, and was there any\nLine 22, 19:01:37: specific instance or behavior from colleagues or superiors that made you feel this way?\nLine 23, 19:01:37: Summary\nLine 24, 19:01:37: In the concluding segment, Mr. Anderson expresses hope that his experience can contribute to a more\nLine 25, 19:01:37: inclusive work environment at Acme. Mr. Thompson then delves deeper into specific aspects of Mr.\nLine 26, 19:01:37: Anderson's experience:\nLine 27, 19:01:37: Complaint process: Mr. Anderson cites discomfort following his supervisor's reaction and difficulty\nLine 28, 19:01:37: navigating the lengthy employee handbook as reasons for not seeking further information.\nLine 29, 19:01:37: Colleague's experience: He mentions briefly discussing his frustrations and concerns with Sarah Lopez\nLine 30, 19:01:37: but clarifies their shared hesitation to pursue formal complaints due to company culture concerns.\nLine 31, 19:01:37: Promotion opportunities and gender bias: He explains the lack of open communication about these\nLine 32, 19:01:37: issues and feeling unspoken pressure due to the absence of women in senior positions, though no\nLine 33, 19:01:37: specific discussions on bias occurred.\nLine 34, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia objects to a leading question about bias, and Mr. Thompson rephrases, allowing Mr.\nLine 35, 19:01:37: Anderson to clarify further. He explains the silent observation among female colleagues of the lack of\n--- End of Page 6 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 7 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:37: female leadership and the perceived need to overachieve compared to male colleagues. Ms. Garcia\nLine 2, 19:01:37: requests further details about the pressure felt by Mr. Anderson.\nLine 3, 19:01:37: Deposition\nLine 4, 19:01:37: Witness: It wasn't any direct confrontation or statement, but more of a subtle feeling arising from\nLine 5, 19:01:37: observing the lack of female representation in leadership roles combined with certain comments about\nLine 6, 19:01:37: needing to \"work harder\" or \"prove myself\" despite my consistent positive performance reviews.\nLine 7, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Thank you, Mr. Anderson. These are valuable insights. Do you have any further\nLine 8, 19:01:37: questions, Ms. Garcia?\nLine 9, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: (after reviewing her notes) I have a few follow-up questions for clarification. However, due\nLine 10, 19:01:37: to the time constraints, I would like to schedule a follow-up session at your earliest convenience, Mr.\nLine 11, 19:01:37: Thompson, to continue exploring specific details and potential evidence.\nLine 12, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: No objection. Mr. Anderson, are you available for a follow-up session within the next\nLine 13, 19:01:37: week?\nLine 14, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, I am available. Please let me know the details when you've scheduled it\nLine 15, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, since our last session, have you had any time to review Acme\nLine 16, 19:01:37: Corporation's employee handbook pertaining to the complaint process for potential discrimination?\nLine 17, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, I have.\nLine 18, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Can you briefly describe the steps outlined in the handbook for filing a complaint based\nLine 19, 19:01:37: on potential discrimination?\nLine 20, 19:01:37: Witness: The handbook mentioned employees could submit a written complaint to the Human\nLine 21, 19:01:37: Resources department or verbally report it to an HR representative or any manager. However, specific\nLine 22, 19:01:37: details about the investigation process or resolution options were quite vague.\nLine 23, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, did the employee handbook specify who constitutes a \"manager\" authorized\nLine 24, 19:01:37: to receive such initial verbal complaints?\nLine 25, 19:01:37: Witness: No, it didn't provide any specific details about which managers were included in that definition\nLine 26, 19:01:37: or if all managers were authorized to receive such reports.\nLine 27, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, you previously mentioned frustration with receiving similar design\nLine 28, 19:01:37: concepts to yours being chosen over your own work while working at Acme. Do you still have copies of\nLine 29, 19:01:37: these original design concepts and the final versions ultimately used?\nLine 30, 19:01:37: Witness: Unfortunately, I didn't retain individual copies of every design iteration. However, I did\nLine 31, 19:01:37: maintain some preliminary sketches and digital drafts from several projects, including the one discussed\nLine 32, 19:01:37: earlier related to the 2023 product launch campaign.\nLine 33, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Would you be willing to provide these materials as potential evidence in this case?\nLine 34, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, I can bring them to the next session.\n--- End of Page 7 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 8 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, are you aware of other colleagues who may have retained copies of their\nLine 2, 19:01:37: rejected design projects or drafts during their employment at Acme?\nLine 3, 19:01:37: Witness: I'm not certain, but I remember several colleagues raising concerns about the inconsistent\nLine 4, 19:01:37: feedback and selection process for design concepts. It's possible some of them might have kept records\nLine 5, 19:01:37: for their own reference.\nLine 6, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: We will look into that possibility. Mr. Anderson, during your time at Acme, did you ever\nLine 7, 19:01:37: meet or hear about any employees who filed official complaints based on experiencing discrimination?\nLine 8, 19:01:37: Witness: Not officially. As mentioned earlier, there was an underlying lack of transparency and open\nLine 9, 19:01:37: communication around potentially sensitive topics like discrimination. Therefore, it was difficult to know\nLine 10, 19:01:37: for sure.\nLine 11, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, did you receive any additional training or workshops related to diversity and\nLine 12, 19:01:37: inclusion since leaving Acme Corporation?\nLine 13, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, my current employer offers comprehensive training programs and workshops regarding\nLine 14, 19:01:37: diversity and inclusion as part of their ongoing commitment to a fair and equitable work environment.\nLine 15, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Do you find these additional training programs and the overall work environment at\nLine 16, 19:01:37: your current company to be beneficial compared to your experience at Acme?\nLine 17, 19:01:37: Witness: Absolutely. The focus on creating a safe space for open communication, valuing diverse\nLine 18, 19:01:37: perspectives, and providing equal opportunities for growth has been incredibly positive and\nLine 19, 19:01:37: empowering.\nLine 20, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: No further questions at this time.\nLine 21, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, as mentioned previously, we would like you to bring copies of the design\nLine 22, 19:01:37: materials you retained for the next session. Additionally, I may reach out to inquire about potential\nLine 23, 19:01:37: colleagues who might have kept similar records. Is that alright?\nLine 24, 19:01:37: Witness: That's perfectly fine. Please let me know if you need anything else in the meantime.\nLine 25, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, one final question before we adjourn. You mentioned feeling hesitant to\nLine 26, 19:01:37: bring up your concerns to your supervisor after their dismissive response. Did their reaction specifically\nLine 27, 19:01:37: mention any consequences of raising the potential bias issue?\nLine 28, 19:01:37: Witness: Not directly. There wasn't an explicit threat of any sort. However, their dismissive tone and the\nLine 29, 19:01:37: implication that my concerns weren't valid created an atmosphere where I felt further discussion would\nLine 30, 19:01:37: be futile and potentially disadvantageous.\nLine 31, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Objection, speculation about the witness's interpretation of a supervisor's tone is not based\nLine 32, 19:01:37: on facts.\nLine 33, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Reframing, Mr. Anderson. How did your supervisor's response make you feel about the\nLine 34, 19:01:37: potential consequences of reporting your concerns?\n--- End of Page 8 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 9 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:38: Witness: Their response discouraged me and made me feel unheard. It conveyed the impression that my\nLine 2, 19:01:38: concerns about potential bias wouldn't be taken seriously and could potentially hinder my career\nLine 3, 19:01:38: progression within the company.\nLine 4, 19:01:38: Summary\nLine 5, 19:01:38: The concluding segment addresses further details and sets the stage for a follow-up session:\nLine 6, 19:01:38: Complaint process: Mr. Anderson reviews the handbook and describes the outlined steps for filing a\nLine 7, 19:01:38: complaint, noting the vagueness regarding investigation and resolution. Ms. Garcia highlights the lack of\nLine 8, 19:01:38: clarity on who qualifies as a \"manager\" authorized to receive initial verbal reports.\nLine 9, 19:01:38: Design concepts: Mr. Anderson clarifies he still possesses some preliminary sketches and drafts,\nLine 10, 19:01:38: including those from the 2023 product launch, and agrees to provide them as potential evidence. Mr.\nLine 11, 19:01:38: Thompson expresses interest in exploring the possibility of other colleagues retaining similar materials.\nLine 12, 19:01:38: Official complaints: Mr. Anderson reiterates the lack of knowledge about any official discrimination\nLine 13, 19:01:38: complaints at Acme due to the previously mentioned culture of secrecy.\nLine 14, 19:01:38: Current company: Mr. Anderson confirms receiving additional diversity and inclusion training at his\nLine 15, 19:01:38: current company. He emphasizes the positive aspects of his new work environment, highlighting open\nLine 16, 19:01:38: communication, valuing diverse perspectives, and equal opportunities, contrasting it with his experience\nLine 17, 19:01:38: at Acme.\nLine 18, 19:01:38: Follow-up: Both parties agree to a follow-up session. Mr. Thompson clarifies his intention to request the\nLine 19, 19:01:38: design materials and potentially contact other colleagues. Ms. Garcia objects to the witness's\nLine 20, 19:01:38: interpretation of his supervisor's tone, leading Mr. Thompson to rephrase the question, to which Mr.\nLine 21, 19:01:38: Anderson reiterates feeling discouraged and unheard, fearing his concerns wouldn't be taken seriously\nLine 22, 19:01:38: and could hinder his career.\nLine 23, 19:01:38: Deposition\nLine 24, 19:01:38: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Thompson, I believe we've covered the essential topics for today. However, as these are\nLine 25, 19:01:38: complex claims, I would appreciate the opportunity to review the transcript and potentially ask further\nLine 26, 19:01:38: questions at a future session, should any need arise.\nLine 27, 19:01:38: Mr. Thompson: No objection. Mr. Anderson, as Ms. Garcia mentioned, we appreciate your willingness to\nLine 28, 19:01:38: cooperate and provide additional materials. We will be in touch to schedule a follow-up session if\nLine 29, 19:01:38: needed.\nLine 30, 19:01:38: Witness: Understood.\nLine 31, 19:01:38: Summary\nLine 32, 19:01:38: The deposition concludes with Ms. Garcia expressing a desire to review the transcript and potentially\nLine 33, 19:01:38: ask further questions in a future session if needed. Mr. Thompson agrees, and both thank Mr. Anderson\nLine 34, 19:01:38: for his cooperation and willingness to provide additional materials. Mr. Anderson acknowledges their\nLine 35, 19:01:38: communication and awaits further information regarding a potential follow-up session.\n--- End of Page 9 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 10 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:38: Deposition\nLine 2, 19:01:38: MILLER: A driver is obligated to pay attention to the road and yield to other drivers when required. Let\nLine 3, 19:01:38: me take you back to what happened on April 20th, 2022. The Defendant, who was an attorney for the\nLine 4, 19:01:38: IRS, was driving her usual route to work. She drove down Annapolis Road to take a left onto another\nLine 5, 19:01:38: road.\nLine 6, 19:01:38: (Could we have the next slide, please?) She was driving down this road\u2026 can everyone see this? She\nLine 7, 19:01:38: stopped at a light on a clear day. While stopped, she reached down to find her parking pass.\nLine 8, 19:01:38: DEFENSE LAWYER: May we approach?\nLine 9, 19:01:38: THE COURT: Yes.\nLine 10, 19:01:38: BENCH CONFERENCE\nLine 11, 19:01:38: (Bench Conference begins \u2013 10:26:39m.)\nLine 12, 19:01:38: (The parties approach the bench for a discussion.)\nLine 13, 19:01:38: THE COURT: By court ruling, liability has been established. The focus of this case is only on damages. I\nLine 14, 19:01:38: understand why we\u2019re discussing these details, but it\u2019s about damages.\nLine 15, 19:01:38: MILLER: I\u2019m setting the scene for the accident because her damages are part of the accident narrative.\nLine 16, 19:01:38: DEFENSE LAWYER: We\u2019re only discussing the fact that an accident happened and a person was injured.\nLine 17, 19:01:38: The details about reaching and negligence seem to be evidence of liability.\nLine 18, 19:01:38: THE COURT: I understand. It\u2019s your opening statement, so I\u2019ll give you some leeway.\nLine 19, 19:01:38: MILLER: I\u2019m just providing context. I\u2019ll be getting into the damages soon.\nLine 20, 19:01:38: THE COURT: Alright.\nLine 21, 19:01:38: (Bench Conference concluded \u2013 10:27:32 m.)\nLine 22, 19:01:38: (The parties return to their places.)\nLine 23, 19:01:38: MILLER: The Defendant heard a horn beep and took a left turn. She didn\u2019t see the Plaintiff, who had the\nLine 24, 19:01:38: right of way, coming from the opposite direction. Due to the collision, the Plaintiff\u2019s ankle was broken\nLine 25, 19:01:38: and required surgery.\nLine 26, 19:01:38: Take a look at these images. The first one shows her ankle before surgery, the second one after surgery.\nLine 27, 19:01:38: Today, she still has 15 screws and three plates in her ankle. She will never be able to run again and\nLine 28, 19:01:38: standing for extended periods of time is difficult.\nLine 29, 19:01:38: We\u2019ve brought this case before you because of the harm caused to the Plaintiff. We needed to agree\nLine 30, 19:01:38: that the Defendant was at fault for the accident, which she has accepted. We also had to understand the\nLine 31, 19:01:38: extent and implications of the Plaintiff\u2019s damages, not just the initial injury and surgery, but also its long-\nLine 32, 19:01:38: term impact on her life.\nLine 33, 19:01:38: To do this, we spoke to her doctors, her husband, her friends, and even her employer. One of her\nLine 34, 19:01:38: doctors is going to talk to you.\n--- End of Page 10 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 11 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:38: This is the guy to see if something awful like this is going to happen to your ankle. He received an Ivy\nLine 2, 19:01:38: League education and, at one point, was the chief of foot and ankle orthopedic injuries at Johns\nLine 3, 19:01:38: Hopkins. He consults for the Baltimore Orioles. His resume, I want to say, is as long as your arm, but it\u2019s\nLine 4, 19:01:38: actually a lot longer than that.\nLine 5, 19:01:38: We\u2019re going to bring him to talk to you guys, in a very 2023 way. It\u2019s going to be by videotape, so his\nLine 6, 19:01:38: testimony will be by videotape, but it holds the same force as if it was at trial, and he came here to see\nLine 7, 19:01:38: us. And, of course, my partner Laura Zois and the defense attorney had an opportunity to ask him\nLine 8, 19:01:38: questions.\nLine 9, 19:01:38: He\u2019s going to tell you she still has 15 screws and three plates in her ankle holding everything together.\nLine 10, 19:01:38: The problem with that is that it creates a breeding ground for arthritis, and this 33-year-old woman\nLine 11, 19:01:38: already has the signs of arthritis. At some point, she\u2019s going to need what\u2019s called a fusion, which will\nLine 12, 19:01:38: stabilize her ankle. The bad news is, you can\u2019t move it once it locks, so you no longer have the ability to\nLine 13, 19:01:38: bend.\nLine 14, 19:01:38: This trial is about the harms and losses that she has suffered and endured as the result of this accident.\nLine 15, 19:01:38: This is not a case about sympathy. You should not award her damages because you feel sorry for her.\nLine 16, 19:01:38: You\u2019re going to hear about how the accident has impacted her professional and personal life.\nLine 17, 19:01:38: At the time of the crash, they were a very young family. They were an energetic family. This is an active\nLine 18, 19:01:38: family with four kids doing everything you can imagine, Six Flags, the park. They would run together.\nLine 19, 19:01:38: They played basketball together. They traveled everywhere, New York, Baltimore, Washington, DC. They\nLine 20, 19:01:38: were just a very active family.\nLine 21, 19:01:38: And she also had a vibrant social life. She was a hairstylist, and she loved that job. It was her social outlet\nLine 22, 19:01:38: beside her kids. She would do the church choir every Wednesday, and still found times to go out and see\nLine 23, 19:01:38: her family. She\u2019s still fighting with her family, but it\u2019s hard.\nLine 24, 19:01:38: She can\u2019t work as a hairstylist anymore. So what did she do? She went back to school to the University\nLine 25, 19:01:38: of Maryland. She\u2019s working, getting very close to getting her degree. She\u2019s still fighting. She has four kids\nLine 26, 19:01:38: they\u2019re chasing around.\nLine 27, 19:01:38: Let\u2019s go back and talk about how it ended up. Let\u2019s talk about the accident. She had this awful crash and\nLine 28, 19:01:38: needed emergency surgery where they put in these screws. She had a nine-month-old baby, along with\nLine 29, 19:01:38: three other kids. She and the two girls, the younger ones, went to live with her mom. Her mom took\nLine 30, 19:01:38: care of her and the girls, while her husband took care of the other kids.\nLine 31, 19:01:38: This has been a massive disruption to their lives. The accident has completely changed her life, and it\u2019s\nLine 32, 19:01:38: reflected in every facet of her day-to-day. Her job, her family life, her hobbies, everything she used to\nLine 33, 19:01:38: take pleasure in has been impacted in one way or another. And the evidence in this case will show these\nLine 34, 19:01:38: changes are likely to persist for the rest of her life.\nLine 35, 19:01:38: We ask you to consider the totality of these changes, the persistent harm and loss she\u2019s suffered and\nLine 36, 19:01:38: will continue to suffer, as a direct result of the accident. We ask you to consider these when coming to a\nLine 37, 19:01:38: decision in this case.\n--- End of Page 11 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 12 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:38: This accident, however, led to an upheaval in their lives. About a month after the accident, she managed\nLine 2, 19:01:38: to return home with the kids. Her mother, an FDA employee, took three months off work to care for her,\nLine 3, 19:01:38: her daughter, and her grandchildren. The accident wreaked havoc on their lives.\nLine 4, 19:01:38: She endured six months of rigorous physical therapy and another operation. While it was painful and\nLine 5, 19:01:38: difficult, the effort was worthwhile as it improved her condition, especially her ankle, though we wish\nLine 6, 19:01:38: she had recovered more.\nLine 7, 19:01:38: As we delve into this case, it\u2019s about the harm and losses experienced. We will ask you to make amends\nLine 8, 19:01:38: where possible and provide compensation for the irreparable harm. The damages can be categorized\nLine 9, 19:01:38: into three parts: her medical bills, the post-accident trauma suffered by her and her family, and the pain\nLine 10, 19:01:38: she will endure for the expected next 45 years of her life.\nLine 11, 19:01:38: She was a spontaneous person, fond of making impromptu plans like going to Virginia Beach over the\nLine 12, 19:01:38: weekend or heading to the park. Now, every activity revolves around her ability to reach there, her\nLine 13, 19:01:38: mobility, and whether she can tolerate the pain during the trip. This situation has affected her and her\nLine 14, 19:01:38: four kids, as well as her husband.\nLine 15, 19:01:38: The court wants to clarify that the evidence and testimonies from the witness stand are what will\nLine 16, 19:01:38: control your deliberations. Opening statements and closing arguments of lawyers do not constitute\nLine 17, 19:01:38: evidence.\nLine 18, 19:01:38: This case is not just about the suffering of their children or her husband. It\u2019s about the impact of their\nLine 19, 19:01:38: suffering on her. We will ask you to consider an amount that may seem high at the beginning. But we\nLine 20, 19:01:38: believe that after hearing all the evidence, you\u2019ll find it to be a fair compensation for her losses and\nLine 21, 19:01:38: harm. The amount we suggest is $1.1 million.\nLine 22, 19:01:38: Defense Opening Statement\nLine 23, 19:01:38: Regarding the defendant, they acknowledge the responsibility for the accident and that it was their\nLine 24, 19:01:38: fault. The case is for you to determine the appropriate damages. The injury is severe, and they ask for an\nLine 25, 19:01:38: extraordinary amount of compensation.\nLine 26, 19:01:38: She broke her ankle, which was repaired surgically with plates and screws. There was a second surgery\nLine 27, 19:01:38: due to loosening of the screws, which were then removed. She attended physical therapy, which\nLine 28, 19:01:38: improved her ability to move her ankle. Whether she will need surgery in the future is uncertain.\nLine 29, 19:01:38: The past medical expenses are around $36,505, which we don\u2019t contest. Her lost wages due to the\nLine 30, 19:01:38: accident are around $3,400 to $3,500. These are not the focal points of this case. The main issue is the\nLine 31, 19:01:38: amount to be awarded for non-economic damages, for which we request something fair, reasonable,\nLine 32, 19:01:38: and sensible.\nLine 33, 19:01:38: Thank you for your time and attention, and we hope to conclude this case promptly.\nLine 34, 19:01:38: Testimony of Victim\u2019s Husband\nLine 35, 19:01:38: Mr. Miller: Good morning. Can I have your address?\nLine 36, 19:01:38: SJ: Certainly.\nLine 37, 19:01:38: Mr. Miller: How long have you lived at that address?\n--- End of Page 12 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 13 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: SJ: I bought the house in 2003, so it\u2019s been approximately ten years.\nLine 2, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Who lives there with you?\nLine 3, 19:01:39: SJ: My wife, and our four children.\nLine 4, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Can you tell the jury how old your children are and their names?\nLine 5, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes. My children are 13, and the others are\u2026\nLine 6, 19:01:39: The Honorable Judge: Please continue.\nLine 7, 19:01:39: SJ: \u2026five, and three.\nLine 8, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: I understand. And for some background, what do you do for a living?\nLine 9, 19:01:39: SJ: I\u2019m currently the general manager at Oreck Clean Home Center.\nLine 10, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: And where are these locations?\nLine 11, 19:01:39: SJ: We have six locations in Maryland and Virginia.\nLine 12, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: What are your responsibilities at work?\nLine 13, 19:01:39: SJ: I oversee all six stores and manage one of them.\nLine 14, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Can you describe your work schedule?\nLine 15, 19:01:39: SJ: I work Monday through Saturday, from 10:00 am to 7:00 pm. Often, I work seven days a week which\nLine 16, 19:01:39: means working on Sundays from 12:00 pm to 5:00 pm.\nLine 17, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: How do you feel about those hours?\nLine 18, 19:01:39: SJ: They are long, but I need to work to support my family.\nLine 19, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: How long have you known your wife?\nLine 20, 19:01:39: SJ: I met her in 1993, she was my sister\u2019s best friend.\nLine 21, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: You mean your wife was your sister\u2019s best friend?\nLine 22, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes, I apologize for the confusion. She was indeed my sister\u2019s best friend.\nLine 23, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Let\u2019s move to another topic. Do you remember the car accident your wife was in 2022?\nLine 24, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes, I do.\nLine 25, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Prior to the accident, can you describe your household?\nLine 26, 19:01:39: SJ: Our household was what I would consider the perfect life. My wife and children were happy and\nLine 27, 19:01:39: always engaged in activities. We used to take vacations and attend family reunions.\nLine 28, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Was your wife a spontaneous person or a planner?\nLine 29, 19:01:39: SJ: She was more spontaneous, always ready to take on new activities.\n--- End of Page 13 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 14 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Could you describe her for the jury?\nLine 2, 19:01:39: SJ: She is always happy, loves socializing and helping people. She attended choir rehearsal, Bible study\nLine 3, 19:01:39: every week, and also took care of our four children.\nLine 4, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: What was her job at the time of the crash?\nLine 5, 19:01:39: SJ: She was the assistant manager of a hair salon.\nLine 6, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Did she enjoy her work?\nLine 7, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes, she loved her work. It was part of her identity.\nLine 8, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Did your wife\u2019s demeanor change after the car accident?\nLine 9, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes, after the accident everything changed. Our family life and activity level changed significantly. She\nLine 10, 19:01:39: used to take the children to sporting events and practice basketball. Now, she can\u2019t do these activities.\nLine 11, 19:01:39: She no longer goes on family vacations. My two older sons call her \u201cboring\u201d now because of her reduced\nLine 12, 19:01:39: activity level. The accident has restricted her capabilities and as a result, she can\u2019t even do simple tasks\nLine 13, 19:01:39: like carrying laundry baskets or standing up to cook. Our family life has changed drastically since the\nLine 14, 19:01:39: accident.\nLine 15, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Has your wife gone back to work since the accident?\nLine 16, 19:01:39: SJ: She tried to help a friend out a couple of months ago at her hair salon, but it ended with her in a lot\nLine 17, 19:01:39: of pain due to the swelling in her ankle.\nLine 18, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: I have here a picture you received from your wife. Is this the picture she sent you?\nLine 19, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Can you tell us how your wife\u2019s personal social life has been affected since the crash?\nLine 20, 19:01:39: SJ: Her social life has indeed changed significantly. Before the accident, she would regularly go out with\nLine 21, 19:01:39: friends, engage in dancing, and other social activities. However, the constant pain and discomfort after\nLine 22, 19:01:39: the crash have made such activities impossible. Her social life is definitely not the same as before.\nLine 23, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: You mentioned earlier about her job. Was she able to resume work post the crash?\nLine 24, 19:01:39: SJ: She attempted to return to work, but the persistent pain made it unmanageable, particularly the\nLine 25, 19:01:39: long-standing hours. Eventually, she was forced to leave her job.\nLine 26, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: How has this situation impacted your family\u2019s finances?\nLine 27, 19:01:39: SJ: The impact has been substantial. She held the position of an assistant manager at a hair salon,\nLine 28, 19:01:39: bringing in a significant income. Now, with my single income, managing expenses for our four children\nLine 29, 19:01:39: and her medical bills has been strenuous.\nLine 30, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Besides the financial struggle, can you share how your relationship with your wife has\nLine 31, 19:01:39: evolved post the accident?\nLine 32, 19:01:39: SJ: Our relationship has undeniably been affected. She isn\u2019t the same person she was before the crash.\nLine 33, 19:01:39: Her constant pain and fatigue, coupled with frustration, have been hard on both of us.\nLine 34, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: And your children? How have they been coping with all these changes?\n--- End of Page 14 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 15 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: SJ: Our children have had to make significant adjustments. They miss the mother they had before the\nLine 2, 19:01:39: crash, not understanding why she can\u2019t engage in the activities she used to do with them. My older\nLine 3, 19:01:39: sons, in particular, have had to step up, assisting more with household chores. It\u2019s been a lot for them\nLine 4, 19:01:39: too.\nLine 5, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Finally, could you share your hopes for your wife\u2019s future?\nLine 6, 19:01:39: SJ: My biggest hope is for her to find relief from her pain and regain some semblance of normalcy. She\nLine 7, 19:01:39: deserves to live her life, not just endure it. It\u2019s challenging to see such a wonderful person go through\nLine 8, 19:01:39: this. We are taking each day as it comes, hoping for a better future.\nLine 9, 19:01:39: Defense Attorney Cross Examination of Victim\u2019s Husband\nLine 10, 19:01:39: Q: Regarding the foot stretching exercises, you assist her with those?\nLine 11, 19:01:39: A: Yes, I do.\nLine 12, 19:01:39: Q: Looking through her medical records, I noticed there\u2019s mention of an exercise bike at home. Do you\nLine 13, 19:01:39: have one?\nLine 14, 19:01:39: A: Indeed, we do have an exercise bike at home.\nLine 15, 19:01:39: Q: Did she frequently use the exercise bike, especially post-accident?\nLine 16, 19:01:39: A: Initially, during her therapy, they had her try riding the exercise bike.\nLine 17, 19:01:39: Q: Can you tell us what kind of exercises she did at home after the accident?\nLine 18, 19:01:39: A: She was given a chart with exercises, and I\u2019ve been helping her to flex her foot in both directions to\nLine 19, 19:01:39: try and loosen it up.\nLine 20, 19:01:39: Q: How long did this routine last?\nLine 21, 19:01:39: A: Actually, I still assist her with the foot exercises every night.\nLine 22, 19:01:39: Q: So you assist her based on the instructions from the chart?\nLine 23, 19:01:39: A: Not directly from the chart, but I\u2019ve learned the correct angles and try to flex her foot every night for\nLine 24, 19:01:39: her comfort and to aid her sleep.\nLine 25, 19:01:39: Q: Does she drive?\nLine 26, 19:01:39: A: Yes, she does.\nLine 27, 19:01:39: Q: Prior to the accident, she was employed full time?\nLine 28, 19:01:39: A: Yes, that\u2019s correct.\nLine 29, 19:01:39: Q: The jury was informed initially that she was also pursuing a degree?\nLine 30, 19:01:39: A: Yes, she was attending the University of Maryland.\nLine 31, 19:01:39: Q: Did she commute to the university?\nLine 32, 19:01:39: A: At certain points she did, but due to our four children, she primarily takes her classes online now.\n--- End of Page 15 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 16 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: Q: How close is she to obtaining her degree?\nLine 2, 19:01:39: A: She\u2019s expected to graduate within the next year.\nLine 3, 19:01:39: Court: Any redirect?\nLine 4, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: No further questions, Your Honor.\nLine 5, 19:01:39: Court: Thank you, sir, you may step down.

Here's a concise summary:\nLine 10, 19:01:39: Before the accident:\nLine 11, 19:01:39: The family was described as happy and engaged in activities, including vacations and family reunions.\nLine 12, 19:01:39: The wife was spontaneous, sociable, and involved in various activities like choir, bible study, and caring\nLine 13, 19:01:39: for their four children.\nLine 14, 19:01:39: She enjoyed her work as an assistant manager at a hair salon.\nLine 15, 19:01:39: After the accident:\nLine 16, 19:01:39: The family life and activity level significantly changed.\nLine 17, 19:01:39: The wife's physical limitations restrict her participation in activities like taking children to events, playing\nLine 18, 19:01:39: sports, or going on family vacations.\nLine 19, 19:01:39: Her reduced activity has even affected how their children perceive her, calling her \"boring.\"\nLine 20, 19:01:39: She struggles with simple tasks like carrying laundry or cooking.\nLine 21, 19:01:39: Impact on the family:\nLine 22, 19:01:39: The wife attempted but couldn't return to work due to pain and difficulty managing long hours.\nLine 23, 19:01:39: The financial burden increased significantly with a single income supporting the family and medical bills.\nLine 24, 19:01:39: The strain on the wife due to pain and frustration has impacted their relationship.\nLine 25, 19:01:39: The children have had to adjust and take on more responsibilities, missing their previous active mother.\nLine 26, 19:01:39: Husband's hope for the future:\nLine 27, 19:01:39: He desires for his wife to find pain relief and regain normalcy in her life.\nLine 28, 19:01:39: Defense cross-examination:\nLine 29, 19:01:39: The husband assists with the wife's foot exercises based on instructions from a chart.\nLine 30, 19:01:39: She still drives and is pursuing a degree online while caring for their children.\n--- End of Page 16 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 17 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: She expects to graduate within the next year.\n--- End of Page 17 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 1 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:53: Deposition:\nLine 2, 19:20:53: Court Reporter: Please state your name for the record.\nLine 3, 19:20:53: Witness: Sarah Miller.\nLine 4, 19:20:53: Court Reporter: And how do you spell your last name, Ms. Miller?\nLine 5, 19:20:53: Witness: M-I-L-L-E-R.\nLine 6, 19:20:53: Mr. Brown: Ms. Miller, are you aware that today's proceedings are a legal deposition and that you are\nLine 7, 19:20:53: under oath to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?\nLine 8, 19:20:53: Witness: Yes, I am aware.\nLine 9, 19:20:53: Mr. Brown: Thank you. Ms. Miller, were you present at the intersection of Main Street and Maple\nLine 10, 19:20:53: Avenue on July 15th, 2023, at approximately 3:00 pm?\nLine 11, 19:20:53: Witness: Yes, I was. I was waiting at the red light on Maple Avenue, southbound, facing east.\nLine 12, 19:20:53: Mr. Brown: Did you witness any accidents at that intersection at that time?\nLine 13, 19:20:53: Witness: Yes, I did. I saw a car traveling westbound on Main Street, which I believe was a blue sedan, run\nLine 14, 19:20:53: the red light and collide with a car traveling northbound on Maple Avenue, which I believe was a white\nLine 15, 19:20:53: SUV.\nLine 16, 19:20:53: Mr. Brown: Can you describe the collision in more detail?\nLine 17, 19:20:53: Witness: The blue sedan seemed to be traveling at a high speed and didn't slow down or attempt to stop\nLine 18, 19:20:53: at the red light. It hit the white SUV directly on the driver's side. The impact was quite forceful, and both\nLine 19, 19:20:53: cars spun around significantly.\nLine 20, 19:20:53: Mr. Lee: Ms. Miller, you mentioned the blue sedan was traveling at a high speed. How fast would you\nLine 21, 19:20:53: say it was going?\nLine 22, 19:20:53: Witness: It's difficult to say for sure, but it appeared to be going much faster than the posted speed\nLine 23, 19:20:53: limit, which is 35 miles per hour.\nLine 24, 19:20:53: Mr. Lee: Did you see the driver of either vehicle at any point?\nLine 25, 19:20:53: Witness: No, I didn't.\nLine 26, 19:20:53: Mr. Brown: Ms. Miller, did you notice anything unusual about the driver's behavior in the blue sedan\nLine 27, 19:20:53: before the accident?\nLine 28, 19:20:53: Witness: It's hard to say. Everything happened very quickly, but the car did seem to be swerving slightly\nLine 29, 19:20:53: just before the collision.\nLine 30, 19:20:53: Mr. Lee: Ms. Miller, did you call the police or offer assistance to anyone involved in the accident?\nLine 31, 19:20:53: Witness: Yes, I immediately called 911 and stayed at the scene until the police arrived.\nLine 32, 19:20:53: Mr. Brown: Did you speak to anyone else who may have witnessed the accident?\n--- End of Page 1 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 2 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:53: Witness: Yes, I exchanged information with another driver who was stopped next to me on Maple\nLine 2, 19:20:53: Avenue at the time.\nLine 3, 19:20:53: Mr. Lee: Do you recall the make and model of the other vehicle that you spoke to?\nLine 4, 19:20:53: Witness: I believe it was a silver Toyota Camry, but I'm not entirely sure.\nLine 5, 19:20:53: Mr. Brown: That's all my questions at this time.\nLine 6, 19:20:53: Mr. Lee: I have no further questions\nLine 7, 19:20:53: Summary:\nLine 8, 19:20:53: The excerpt is from a legal deposition of Michael Anderson, who is under oath to tell the truth. Mr.\nLine 9, 19:20:53: Anderson confirms his employment at Acme Corporation as a graphic designer and details his job duties.\nLine 10, 19:20:53: He also confirms receiving positive performance reviews and never facing disciplinary actions. The\nLine 11, 19:20:53: excerpt ends with a question about witnessing or experiencing any discriminatory situations at Acme.\n--- End of Page 2 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 3 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:53: Deposition:\nLine 2, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Objection, that question calls for legal conclusions from the witness.\nLine 3, 19:20:53: Mr. Thompson: Withdrawn. Mr. Anderson, please describe any specific incidents or instances at Acme\nLine 4, 19:20:53: that involved your [protected category].\nLine 5, 19:20:53: Witness: There were several things that made me feel uncomfortable. During meetings, colleagues often\nLine 6, 19:20:53: talked over me or dismissed my ideas, particularly when compared to my younger male colleagues. I\nLine 7, 19:20:53: was also consistently passed over for promotions despite having experience and qualifications\nLine 8, 19:20:53: comparable to others who got promoted.\nLine 9, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you be specific about which colleagues treated you this way and provide\nLine 10, 19:20:53: specific examples of situations where these incidents occurred?\nLine 11, 19:20:53: Witness: One specific example would be the marketing campaign for the new product launch in 2023. I\nLine 12, 19:20:53: put significant effort into developing design concepts, but they were ultimately disregarded without any\nLine 13, 19:20:53: explanation. My male colleague's design, which was very similar to mine, was ultimately chosen.\nLine 14, 19:20:53: Mr. Thompson: Did you ever report any of these incidents to your supervisor or anyone else at Acme?\nLine 15, 19:20:53: Witness: I once mentioned feeling undervalued to my supervisor, but they brushed it off, suggesting I\nLine 16, 19:20:53: needed to \"work harder to prove myself.\" I wasn't comfortable bringing it up further after that.\nLine 17, 19:20:53: Mr. Thompson: Did you decide to leave Acme voluntarily, or were you terminated?\nLine 18, 19:20:53: Witness: When they announced another promotion I felt qualified for, but was once again passed over\nLine 19, 19:20:53: without explanation, I decided it was time to find a new position where I felt valued and respected.\nLine 20, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you confirm that your decision to leave Acme was solely based on not\nLine 21, 19:20:53: receiving the promotion, and not due to other factors like job performance or personal reasons?\nLine 22, 19:20:53: Witness: To the best of my knowledge, yes. It became clear to me that further advancement\nLine 23, 19:20:53: opportunities within the company were unlikely.\nLine 24, 19:20:53: Mr. Thompson: That's all my questions at this time.\nLine 25, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, during your time at Acme, did you ever receive any negative performance\nLine 26, 19:20:53: reviews or warnings related to your work performance?\nLine 27, 19:20:53: Witness: No, as mentioned before, my performance reviews were always positive.\nLine 28, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Did you ever attend any diversity and inclusion training offered by Acme during your\nLine 29, 19:20:53: employment?\nLine 30, 19:20:53: Witness: I did participate in the mandatory online training modules, but there weren't any specific\nLine 31, 19:20:53: training sessions related to addressing or reporting potentially discriminatory situations within the\nLine 32, 19:20:53: company.\nLine 33, 19:20:53: Summary\n--- End of Page 3 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 4 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:53: Michael Anderson details specific incidents supporting his feeling of being undervalued based on his\nLine 2, 19:20:53: protected category. He describes colleagues disregarding his ideas and being passed over for\nLine 3, 19:20:53: promotions despite comparable qualifications. He provides a specific example from the 2023 product\nLine 4, 19:20:53: launch where his design was overlooked in favor of a male colleague's similar work. He mentions\nLine 5, 19:20:53: mentioning his concerns to his supervisor but being discouraged from pursuing them. He clarifies his\nLine 6, 19:20:53: decision to leave Acme was due to the lack of advancement opportunities, not performance or personal\nLine 7, 19:20:53: reasons. Ms. Garcia then establishes that Mr. Anderson's performance was consistently good and that\nLine 8, 19:20:53: he participated in available diversity training while at Acme, though specific training for addressing\nLine 9, 19:20:53: potential discrimination was absent.\nLine 10, 19:20:53: Deposition:\nLine 11, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, are you aware of Acme's anti-discrimination policy or how complaints of\nLine 12, 19:20:53: discrimination are addressed within the company?\nLine 13, 19:20:53: Witness: I reviewed the employee handbook, which did explain the existence of an anti-discrimination\nLine 14, 19:20:53: policy. However, I was unsure of the specific complaint process at the time\nLine 15, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you elaborate on why you felt apprehensive about bringing up these\nLine 16, 19:20:53: incidents to your supervisor despite feeling uncomfortable and undervalued?\nLine 17, 19:20:53: Witness: Honestly, there were a few reasons. Firstly, as I mentioned, when I did hint at feeling\nLine 18, 19:20:53: undervalued to my supervisor, their dismissive response discouraged me from further discussions. It\nLine 19, 19:20:53: seemed like they weren't receptive to hearing about any potential issues.\nLine 20, 19:20:53: Secondly, there was a general company culture that made me hesitant to speak up. Younger male\nLine 21, 19:20:53: colleagues often dominated conversations and presentations, and there weren't many women in senior\nLine 22, 19:20:53: positions within the marketing department. It felt like my voice wouldn't be heard or even worse, that\nLine 23, 19:20:53: bringing forward complaints might lead to retaliation or hinder my career further.\nLine 24, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Did you notice any specific instances of retaliation against other employees who may have\nLine 25, 19:20:53: raised complaints or concerns about work environment issues?\nLine 26, 19:20:53: Witness: While I can't say for sure, there was one colleague, Sarah Lopez, who openly challenged gender\nLine 27, 19:20:53: bias during a department meeting but was subsequently given less desirable project assignments\nLine 28, 19:20:53: compared to her male colleagues. This incident definitely reinforced my concerns about potentially\nLine 29, 19:20:53: facing a similar situation.**\nLine 30, 19:20:53: Mr. Thompson: Objection, speculation about an unrelated case is irrelevant to the present matter.\nLine 31, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Withdrawn. Mr. Anderson, did you ever discuss your concerns about potential bias or lack of\nLine 32, 19:20:53: promotion opportunities with any human resources personnel at Acme?\nLine 33, 19:20:53: Witness: No, I didn't. As I mentioned before, the lack of clarity on the specific complaint process\nLine 34, 19:20:53: combined with the overall culture discouraged me from pursuing that route.\nLine 35, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, since leaving Acme, have you sought employment elsewhere?\n--- End of Page 4 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 5 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:54: Witness: Yes, I am currently employed at a different company and feel much more valued and respected\nLine 2, 19:20:54: in my current role. The work environment is significantly more inclusive, and I regularly receive positive\nLine 3, 19:20:54: feedback and opportunities for professional development.\nLine 4, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, how has your experience at Acme impacted you personally and\nLine 5, 19:20:54: professionally?\nLine 6, 19:20:54: Witness: It was definitely a frustrating and discouraging experience. It felt like my hard work and\nLine 7, 19:20:54: qualifications weren't being recognized fairly, leading to some self-doubt and a sense of being\nLine 8, 19:20:54: undervalued. However, finding a new and positive work environment has helped me rebuild my\nLine 9, 19:20:54: confidence and refocus on my career goals.\nLine 10, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: I have no further questions.\nLine 11, 19:20:54: Summary\nLine 12, 19:20:54: This segment explores Mr. Anderson's reasons for not formally complaining despite feeling undervalued.\nLine 13, 19:20:54: He reiterates his supervisor's dismissive response and the perceived lack of receptiveness within the\nLine 14, 19:20:54: company culture. He describes a specific instance where a colleague who challenged gender bias faced\nLine 15, 19:20:54: negative consequences, reinforcing his fear of retaliation. He clarifies that he didn't pursue HR due to\nLine 16, 19:20:54: unclear procedures and the discouraging company culture. Finally, he highlights his positive experience\nLine 17, 19:20:54: at a new company, emphasizing feelings of value, inclusion, and professional growth in contrast to his\nLine 18, 19:20:54: experience at Acme. He concludes by acknowledging the frustration and self-doubt from Acme but also\nLine 19, 19:20:54: the positive impact of finding a supportive work environment.\nLine 20, 19:20:54: Deposition\nLine 21, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: I have one final question. Mr. Anderson, is there anything else you would like to add\nLine 22, 19:20:54: regarding your experience at Acme Corporation?\nLine 23, 19:20:54: Witness: Just that I hope by sharing my story, it can contribute to fostering a more diverse and inclusive\nLine 24, 19:20:54: work environment at Acme for future employees. Everyone deserves to feel valued and respected in\nLine 25, 19:20:54: their workplace, regardless of their [protected category].\nLine 26, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Interesting point, Mr. Anderson. Ms. Garcia, while you have no further questions, I'd like\nLine 27, 19:20:54: to explore some aspects of Mr. Anderson's experience further before concluding the deposition.\nLine 28, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: No objection. Please proceed, Mr. Thompson.\nLine 29, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, you mentioned feeling unsure about the specific complaint process at\nLine 30, 19:20:54: Acme. Did you take any steps to learn more about it after your meeting with your supervisor?\nLine 31, 19:20:54: Witness: No, I didn't feel comfortable approaching my supervisor again after their dismissive response.\nLine 32, 19:20:54: Additionally, I recall the employee handbook being quite lengthy, and finding specific information about\nLine 33, 19:20:54: the complaint process proved difficult at the time.\n--- End of Page 5 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 6 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: You mentioned a colleague, Sarah Lopez, who voiced concerns about gender bias. Did\nLine 2, 19:20:54: you ever speak to her directly about her experience and the alleged retaliation she faced?\nLine 3, 19:20:54: Witness: Briefly, yes. We expressed our mutual frustrations and the feeling of being undervalued within\nLine 4, 19:20:54: the department. However, we were both hesitant to pursue any formal complaints due to the\nLine 5, 19:20:54: aforementioned concerns about the company culture and potential retaliation.\nLine 6, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Did you ever discuss the issue of lack of promotion opportunities with any other\nLine 7, 19:20:54: colleagues, particularly women in the marketing department?\nLine 8, 19:20:54: Witness: Not directly. While there were a few women colleagues in the department, none of them were\nLine 9, 19:20:54: in senior positions. The general environment discouraged open communication about potentially\nLine 10, 19:20:54: sensitive topics like discrimination.\nLine 11, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Thompson, I object to leading the witness. Can you rephrase your question and allow\nLine 12, 19:20:54: Mr. Anderson to answer in his own words?\nLine 13, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Apologies, Ms. Garcia. Mr. Anderson, to clarify, did you have any informal conversations\nLine 14, 19:20:54: with other colleagues about your concerns regarding promotion opportunities or potential gender bias\nLine 15, 19:20:54: within the marketing department at Acme?\nLine 16, 19:20:54: Witness: There weren't any specific discussions about promotions or bias, but the general atmosphere\nLine 17, 19:20:54: around the lack of female representation in senior positions was a frequent topic of quiet observation\nLine 18, 19:20:54: amongst some female colleagues. We felt implicit pressure to work harder and prove ourselves more\nLine 19, 19:20:54: than our male colleagues, but reaching leadership positions seemed like an increasingly distant\nLine 20, 19:20:54: prospect.\nLine 21, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you elaborate on what kind of \"pressure\" you felt, and was there any\nLine 22, 19:20:54: specific instance or behavior from colleagues or superiors that made you feel this way?\nLine 23, 19:20:54: Summary\nLine 24, 19:20:54: In the concluding segment, Mr. Anderson expresses hope that his experience can contribute to a more\nLine 25, 19:20:54: inclusive work environment at Acme. Mr. Thompson then delves deeper into specific aspects of Mr.\nLine 26, 19:20:54: Anderson's experience:\nLine 27, 19:20:54: Complaint process: Mr. Anderson cites discomfort following his supervisor's reaction and difficulty\nLine 28, 19:20:54: navigating the lengthy employee handbook as reasons for not seeking further information.\nLine 29, 19:20:54: Colleague's experience: He mentions briefly discussing his frustrations and concerns with Sarah Lopez\nLine 30, 19:20:54: but clarifies their shared hesitation to pursue formal complaints due to company culture concerns.\nLine 31, 19:20:54: Promotion opportunities and gender bias: He explains the lack of open communication about these\nLine 32, 19:20:54: issues and feeling unspoken pressure due to the absence of women in senior positions, though no\nLine 33, 19:20:54: specific discussions on bias occurred.\nLine 34, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia objects to a leading question about bias, and Mr. Thompson rephrases, allowing Mr.\nLine 35, 19:20:54: Anderson to clarify further. He explains the silent observation among female colleagues of the lack of\n--- End of Page 6 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 7 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:54: female leadership and the perceived need to overachieve compared to male colleagues. Ms. Garcia\nLine 2, 19:20:54: requests further details about the pressure felt by Mr. Anderson.\nLine 3, 19:20:54: Deposition\nLine 4, 19:20:54: Witness: It wasn't any direct confrontation or statement, but more of a subtle feeling arising from\nLine 5, 19:20:54: observing the lack of female representation in leadership roles combined with certain comments about\nLine 6, 19:20:54: needing to \"work harder\" or \"prove myself\" despite my consistent positive performance reviews.\nLine 7, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Thank you, Mr. Anderson. These are valuable insights. Do you have any further\nLine 8, 19:20:54: questions, Ms. Garcia?\nLine 9, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: (after reviewing her notes) I have a few follow-up questions for clarification. However, due\nLine 10, 19:20:54: to the time constraints, I would like to schedule a follow-up session at your earliest convenience, Mr.\nLine 11, 19:20:54: Thompson, to continue exploring specific details and potential evidence.\nLine 12, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: No objection. Mr. Anderson, are you available for a follow-up session within the next\nLine 13, 19:20:54: week?\nLine 14, 19:20:54: Witness: Yes, I am available. Please let me know the details when you've scheduled it\nLine 15, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, since our last session, have you had any time to review Acme\nLine 16, 19:20:54: Corporation's employee handbook pertaining to the complaint process for potential discrimination?\nLine 17, 19:20:54: Witness: Yes, I have.\nLine 18, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Can you briefly describe the steps outlined in the handbook for filing a complaint based\nLine 19, 19:20:54: on potential discrimination?\nLine 20, 19:20:54: Witness: The handbook mentioned employees could submit a written complaint to the Human\nLine 21, 19:20:54: Resources department or verbally report it to an HR representative or any manager. However, specific\nLine 22, 19:20:54: details about the investigation process or resolution options were quite vague.\nLine 23, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, did the employee handbook specify who constitutes a \"manager\" authorized\nLine 24, 19:20:54: to receive such initial verbal complaints?\nLine 25, 19:20:54: Witness: No, it didn't provide any specific details about which managers were included in that definition\nLine 26, 19:20:54: or if all managers were authorized to receive such reports.\nLine 27, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, you previously mentioned frustration with receiving similar design\nLine 28, 19:20:54: concepts to yours being chosen over your own work while working at Acme. Do you still have copies of\nLine 29, 19:20:54: these original design concepts and the final versions ultimately used?\nLine 30, 19:20:54: Witness: Unfortunately, I didn't retain individual copies of every design iteration. However, I did\nLine 31, 19:20:54: maintain some preliminary sketches and digital drafts from several projects, including the one discussed\nLine 32, 19:20:54: earlier related to the 2023 product launch campaign.\nLine 33, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Would you be willing to provide these materials as potential evidence in this case?\nLine 34, 19:20:54: Witness: Yes, I can bring them to the next session.\n--- End of Page 7 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 8 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, are you aware of other colleagues who may have retained copies of their\nLine 2, 19:20:54: rejected design projects or drafts during their employment at Acme?\nLine 3, 19:20:54: Witness: I'm not certain, but I remember several colleagues raising concerns about the inconsistent\nLine 4, 19:20:54: feedback and selection process for design concepts. It's possible some of them might have kept records\nLine 5, 19:20:54: for their own reference.\nLine 6, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: We will look into that possibility. Mr. Anderson, during your time at Acme, did you ever\nLine 7, 19:20:54: meet or hear about any employees who filed official complaints based on experiencing discrimination?\nLine 8, 19:20:54: Witness: Not officially. As mentioned earlier, there was an underlying lack of transparency and open\nLine 9, 19:20:54: communication around potentially sensitive topics like discrimination. Therefore, it was difficult to know\nLine 10, 19:20:54: for sure.\nLine 11, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, did you receive any additional training or workshops related to diversity and\nLine 12, 19:20:54: inclusion since leaving Acme Corporation?\nLine 13, 19:20:54: Witness: Yes, my current employer offers comprehensive training programs and workshops regarding\nLine 14, 19:20:54: diversity and inclusion as part of their ongoing commitment to a fair and equitable work environment.\nLine 15, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Do you find these additional training programs and the overall work environment at\nLine 16, 19:20:54: your current company to be beneficial compared to your experience at Acme?\nLine 17, 19:20:54: Witness: Absolutely. The focus on creating a safe space for open communication, valuing diverse\nLine 18, 19:20:54: perspectives, and providing equal opportunities for growth has been incredibly positive and\nLine 19, 19:20:54: empowering.\nLine 20, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: No further questions at this time.\nLine 21, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, as mentioned previously, we would like you to bring copies of the design\nLine 22, 19:20:54: materials you retained for the next session. Additionally, I may reach out to inquire about potential\nLine 23, 19:20:54: colleagues who might have kept similar records. Is that alright?\nLine 24, 19:20:54: Witness: That's perfectly fine. Please let me know if you need anything else in the meantime.\nLine 25, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, one final question before we adjourn. You mentioned feeling hesitant to\nLine 26, 19:20:54: bring up your concerns to your supervisor after their dismissive response. Did their reaction specifically\nLine 27, 19:20:54: mention any consequences of raising the potential bias issue?\nLine 28, 19:20:54: Witness: Not directly. There wasn't an explicit threat of any sort. However, their dismissive tone and the\nLine 29, 19:20:54: implication that my concerns weren't valid created an atmosphere where I felt further discussion would\nLine 30, 19:20:54: be futile and potentially disadvantageous.\nLine 31, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: Objection, speculation about the witness's interpretation of a supervisor's tone is not based\nLine 32, 19:20:54: on facts.\nLine 33, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Reframing, Mr. Anderson. How did your supervisor's response make you feel about the\nLine 34, 19:20:54: potential consequences of reporting your concerns?\n--- End of Page 8 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 9 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:55: Witness: Their response discouraged me and made me feel unheard. It conveyed the impression that my\nLine 2, 19:20:55: concerns about potential bias wouldn't be taken seriously and could potentially hinder my career\nLine 3, 19:20:55: progression within the company.\nLine 4, 19:20:55: Summary\nLine 5, 19:20:55: The concluding segment addresses further details and sets the stage for a follow-up session:\nLine 6, 19:20:55: Complaint process: Mr. Anderson reviews the handbook and describes the outlined steps for filing a\nLine 7, 19:20:55: complaint, noting the vagueness regarding investigation and resolution. Ms. Garcia highlights the lack of\nLine 8, 19:20:55: clarity on who qualifies as a \"manager\" authorized to receive initial verbal reports.\nLine 9, 19:20:55: Design concepts: Mr. Anderson clarifies he still possesses some preliminary sketches and drafts,\nLine 10, 19:20:55: including those from the 2023 product launch, and agrees to provide them as potential evidence. Mr.\nLine 11, 19:20:55: Thompson expresses interest in exploring the possibility of other colleagues retaining similar materials.\nLine 12, 19:20:55: Official complaints: Mr. Anderson reiterates the lack of knowledge about any official discrimination\nLine 13, 19:20:55: complaints at Acme due to the previously mentioned culture of secrecy.\nLine 14, 19:20:55: Current company: Mr. Anderson confirms receiving additional diversity and inclusion training at his\nLine 15, 19:20:55: current company. He emphasizes the positive aspects of his new work environment, highlighting open\nLine 16, 19:20:55: communication, valuing diverse perspectives, and equal opportunities, contrasting it with his experience\nLine 17, 19:20:55: at Acme.\nLine 18, 19:20:55: Follow-up: Both parties agree to a follow-up session. Mr. Thompson clarifies his intention to request the\nLine 19, 19:20:55: design materials and potentially contact other colleagues. Ms. Garcia objects to the witness's\nLine 20, 19:20:55: interpretation of his supervisor's tone, leading Mr. Thompson to rephrase the question, to which Mr.\nLine 21, 19:20:55: Anderson reiterates feeling discouraged and unheard, fearing his concerns wouldn't be taken seriously\nLine 22, 19:20:55: and could hinder his career.\nLine 23, 19:20:55: Deposition\nLine 24, 19:20:55: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Thompson, I believe we've covered the essential topics for today. However, as these are\nLine 25, 19:20:55: complex claims, I would appreciate the opportunity to review the transcript and potentially ask further\nLine 26, 19:20:55: questions at a future session, should any need arise.\nLine 27, 19:20:55: Mr. Thompson: No objection. Mr. Anderson, as Ms. Garcia mentioned, we appreciate your willingness to\nLine 28, 19:20:55: cooperate and provide additional materials. We will be in touch to schedule a follow-up session if\nLine 29, 19:20:55: needed.\nLine 30, 19:20:55: Witness: Understood.\nLine 31, 19:20:55: Summary\nLine 32, 19:20:55: The deposition concludes with Ms. Garcia expressing a desire to review the transcript and potentially\nLine 33, 19:20:55: ask further questions in a future session if needed. Mr. Thompson agrees, and both thank Mr. Anderson\nLine 34, 19:20:55: for his cooperation and willingness to provide additional materials. Mr. Anderson acknowledges their\nLine 35, 19:20:55: communication and awaits further information regarding a potential follow-up session.\n--- End of Page 9 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 10 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:55: Deposition\nLine 2, 19:20:55: MILLER: A driver is obligated to pay attention to the road and yield to other drivers when required. Let\nLine 3, 19:20:55: me take you back to what happened on April 20th, 2022. The Defendant, who was an attorney for the\nLine 4, 19:20:55: IRS, was driving her usual route to work. She drove down Annapolis Road to take a left onto another\nLine 5, 19:20:55: road.\nLine 6, 19:20:55: (Could we have the next slide, please?) She was driving down this road\u2026 can everyone see this? She\nLine 7, 19:20:55: stopped at a light on a clear day. While stopped, she reached down to find her parking pass.\nLine 8, 19:20:55: DEFENSE LAWYER: May we approach?\nLine 9, 19:20:55: THE COURT: Yes.\nLine 10, 19:20:55: BENCH CONFERENCE\nLine 11, 19:20:55: (Bench Conference begins \u2013 10:26:39m.)\nLine 12, 19:20:55: (The parties approach the bench for a discussion.)\nLine 13, 19:20:55: THE COURT: By court ruling, liability has been established. The focus of this case is only on damages. I\nLine 14, 19:20:55: understand why we\u2019re discussing these details, but it\u2019s about damages.\nLine 15, 19:20:55: MILLER: I\u2019m setting the scene for the accident because her damages are part of the accident narrative.\nLine 16, 19:20:55: DEFENSE LAWYER: We\u2019re only discussing the fact that an accident happened and a person was injured.\nLine 17, 19:20:55: The details about reaching and negligence seem to be evidence of liability.\nLine 18, 19:20:55: THE COURT: I understand. It\u2019s your opening statement, so I\u2019ll give you some leeway.\nLine 19, 19:20:55: MILLER: I\u2019m just providing context. I\u2019ll be getting into the damages soon.\nLine 20, 19:20:55: THE COURT: Alright.\nLine 21, 19:20:55: (Bench Conference concluded \u2013 10:27:32 m.)\nLine 22, 19:20:55: (The parties return to their places.)\nLine 23, 19:20:55: MILLER: The Defendant heard a horn beep and took a left turn. She didn\u2019t see the Plaintiff, who had the\nLine 24, 19:20:55: right of way, coming from the opposite direction. Due to the collision, the Plaintiff\u2019s ankle was broken\nLine 25, 19:20:55: and required surgery.\nLine 26, 19:20:55: Take a look at these images. The first one shows her ankle before surgery, the second one after surgery.\nLine 27, 19:20:55: Today, she still has 15 screws and three plates in her ankle. She will never be able to run again and\nLine 28, 19:20:55: standing for extended periods of time is difficult.\nLine 29, 19:20:55: We\u2019ve brought this case before you because of the harm caused to the Plaintiff. We needed to agree\nLine 30, 19:20:55: that the Defendant was at fault for the accident, which she has accepted. We also had to understand the\nLine 31, 19:20:55: extent and implications of the Plaintiff\u2019s damages, not just the initial injury and surgery, but also its long-\nLine 32, 19:20:55: term impact on her life.\nLine 33, 19:20:55: To do this, we spoke to her doctors, her husband, her friends, and even her employer. One of her\nLine 34, 19:20:55: doctors is going to talk to you.\n--- End of Page 10 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 11 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:55: This is the guy to see if something awful like this is going to happen to your ankle. He received an Ivy\nLine 2, 19:20:55: League education and, at one point, was the chief of foot and ankle orthopedic injuries at Johns\nLine 3, 19:20:55: Hopkins. He consults for the Baltimore Orioles. His resume, I want to say, is as long as your arm, but it\u2019s\nLine 4, 19:20:55: actually a lot longer than that.\nLine 5, 19:20:55: We\u2019re going to bring him to talk to you guys, in a very 2023 way. It\u2019s going to be by videotape, so his\nLine 6, 19:20:55: testimony will be by videotape, but it holds the same force as if it was at trial, and he came here to see\nLine 7, 19:20:55: us. And, of course, my partner Laura Zois and the defense attorney had an opportunity to ask him\nLine 8, 19:20:55: questions.\nLine 9, 19:20:55: He\u2019s going to tell you she still has 15 screws and three plates in her ankle holding everything together.\nLine 10, 19:20:55: The problem with that is that it creates a breeding ground for arthritis, and this 33-year-old woman\nLine 11, 19:20:55: already has the signs of arthritis. At some point, she\u2019s going to need what\u2019s called a fusion, which will\nLine 12, 19:20:55: stabilize her ankle. The bad news is, you can\u2019t move it once it locks, so you no longer have the ability to\nLine 13, 19:20:55: bend.\nLine 14, 19:20:55: This trial is about the harms and losses that she has suffered and endured as the result of this accident.\nLine 15, 19:20:55: This is not a case about sympathy. You should not award her damages because you feel sorry for her.\nLine 16, 19:20:55: You\u2019re going to hear about how the accident has impacted her professional and personal life.\nLine 17, 19:20:55: At the time of the crash, they were a very young family. They were an energetic family. This is an active\nLine 18, 19:20:55: family with four kids doing everything you can imagine, Six Flags, the park. They would run together.\nLine 19, 19:20:55: They played basketball together. They traveled everywhere, New York, Baltimore, Washington, DC. They\nLine 20, 19:20:55: were just a very active family.\nLine 21, 19:20:55: And she also had a vibrant social life. She was a hairstylist, and she loved that job. It was her social outlet\nLine 22, 19:20:55: beside her kids. She would do the church choir every Wednesday, and still found times to go out and see\nLine 23, 19:20:55: her family. She\u2019s still fighting with her family, but it\u2019s hard.\nLine 24, 19:20:55: She can\u2019t work as a hairstylist anymore. So what did she do? She went back to school to the University\nLine 25, 19:20:55: of Maryland. She\u2019s working, getting very close to getting her degree. She\u2019s still fighting. She has four kids\nLine 26, 19:20:55: they\u2019re chasing around.\nLine 27, 19:20:55: Let\u2019s go back and talk about how it ended up. Let\u2019s talk about the accident. She had this awful crash and\nLine 28, 19:20:55: needed emergency surgery where they put in these screws. She had a nine-month-old baby, along with\nLine 29, 19:20:55: three other kids. She and the two girls, the younger ones, went to live with her mom. Her mom took\nLine 30, 19:20:55: care of her and the girls, while her husband took care of the other kids.\nLine 31, 19:20:55: This has been a massive disruption to their lives. The accident has completely changed her life, and it\u2019s\nLine 32, 19:20:55: reflected in every facet of her day-to-day. Her job, her family life, her hobbies, everything she used to\nLine 33, 19:20:55: take pleasure in has been impacted in one way or another. And the evidence in this case will show these\nLine 34, 19:20:55: changes are likely to persist for the rest of her life.\nLine 35, 19:20:55: We ask you to consider the totality of these changes, the persistent harm and loss she\u2019s suffered and\nLine 36, 19:20:55: will continue to suffer, as a direct result of the accident. We ask you to consider these when coming to a\nLine 37, 19:20:55: decision in this case.\n--- End of Page 11 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 12 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:55: This accident, however, led to an upheaval in their lives. About a month after the accident, she managed\nLine 2, 19:20:55: to return home with the kids. Her mother, an FDA employee, took three months off work to care for her,\nLine 3, 19:20:55: her daughter, and her grandchildren. The accident wreaked havoc on their lives.\nLine 4, 19:20:55: She endured six months of rigorous physical therapy and another operation. While it was painful and\nLine 5, 19:20:55: difficult, the effort was worthwhile as it improved her condition, especially her ankle, though we wish\nLine 6, 19:20:55: she had recovered more.\nLine 7, 19:20:55: As we delve into this case, it\u2019s about the harm and losses experienced. We will ask you to make amends\nLine 8, 19:20:55: where possible and provide compensation for the irreparable harm. The damages can be categorized\nLine 9, 19:20:55: into three parts: her medical bills, the post-accident trauma suffered by her and her family, and the pain\nLine 10, 19:20:55: she will endure for the expected next 45 years of her life.\nLine 11, 19:20:55: She was a spontaneous person, fond of making impromptu plans like going to Virginia Beach over the\nLine 12, 19:20:55: weekend or heading to the park. Now, every activity revolves around her ability to reach there, her\nLine 13, 19:20:55: mobility, and whether she can tolerate the pain during the trip. This situation has affected her and her\nLine 14, 19:20:55: four kids, as well as her husband.\nLine 15, 19:20:55: The court wants to clarify that the evidence and testimonies from the witness stand are what will\nLine 16, 19:20:55: control your deliberations. Opening statements and closing arguments of lawyers do not constitute\nLine 17, 19:20:55: evidence.\nLine 18, 19:20:55: This case is not just about the suffering of their children or her husband. It\u2019s about the impact of their\nLine 19, 19:20:55: suffering on her. We will ask you to consider an amount that may seem high at the beginning. But we\nLine 20, 19:20:55: believe that after hearing all the evidence, you\u2019ll find it to be a fair compensation for her losses and\nLine 21, 19:20:55: harm. The amount we suggest is $1.1 million.\nLine 22, 19:20:55: Defense Opening Statement\nLine 23, 19:20:55: Regarding the defendant, they acknowledge the responsibility for the accident and that it was their\nLine 24, 19:20:55: fault. The case is for you to determine the appropriate damages. The injury is severe, and they ask for an\nLine 25, 19:20:55: extraordinary amount of compensation.\nLine 26, 19:20:55: She broke her ankle, which was repaired surgically with plates and screws. There was a second surgery\nLine 27, 19:20:55: due to loosening of the screws, which were then removed. She attended physical therapy, which\nLine 28, 19:20:55: improved her ability to move her ankle. Whether she will need surgery in the future is uncertain.\nLine 29, 19:20:55: The past medical expenses are around $36,505, which we don\u2019t contest. Her lost wages due to the\nLine 30, 19:20:55: accident are around $3,400 to $3,500. These are not the focal points of this case. The main issue is the\nLine 31, 19:20:55: amount to be awarded for non-economic damages, for which we request something fair, reasonable,\nLine 32, 19:20:55: and sensible.\nLine 33, 19:20:55: Thank you for your time and attention, and we hope to conclude this case promptly.\nLine 34, 19:20:55: Testimony of Victim\u2019s Husband\nLine 35, 19:20:55: Mr. Miller: Good morning. Can I have your address?\nLine 36, 19:20:55: SJ: Certainly.\nLine 37, 19:20:55: Mr. Miller: How long have you lived at that address?\n--- End of Page 12 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 13 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:56: SJ: I bought the house in 2003, so it\u2019s been approximately ten years.\nLine 2, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Who lives there with you?\nLine 3, 19:20:56: SJ: My wife, and our four children.\nLine 4, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Can you tell the jury how old your children are and their names?\nLine 5, 19:20:56: SJ: Yes. My children are 13, and the others are\u2026\nLine 6, 19:20:56: The Honorable Judge: Please continue.\nLine 7, 19:20:56: SJ: \u2026five, and three.\nLine 8, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: I understand. And for some background, what do you do for a living?\nLine 9, 19:20:56: SJ: I\u2019m currently the general manager at Oreck Clean Home Center.\nLine 10, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: And where are these locations?\nLine 11, 19:20:56: SJ: We have six locations in Maryland and Virginia.\nLine 12, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: What are your responsibilities at work?\nLine 13, 19:20:56: SJ: I oversee all six stores and manage one of them.\nLine 14, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Can you describe your work schedule?\nLine 15, 19:20:56: SJ: I work Monday through Saturday, from 10:00 am to 7:00 pm. Often, I work seven days a week which\nLine 16, 19:20:56: means working on Sundays from 12:00 pm to 5:00 pm.\nLine 17, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: How do you feel about those hours?\nLine 18, 19:20:56: SJ: They are long, but I need to work to support my family.\nLine 19, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: How long have you known your wife?\nLine 20, 19:20:56: SJ: I met her in 1993, she was my sister\u2019s best friend.\nLine 21, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: You mean your wife was your sister\u2019s best friend?\nLine 22, 19:20:56: SJ: Yes, I apologize for the confusion. She was indeed my sister\u2019s best friend.\nLine 23, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Let\u2019s move to another topic. Do you remember the car accident your wife was in 2022?\nLine 24, 19:20:56: SJ: Yes, I do.\nLine 25, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Prior to the accident, can you describe your household?\nLine 26, 19:20:56: SJ: Our household was what I would consider the perfect life. My wife and children were happy and\nLine 27, 19:20:56: always engaged in activities. We used to take vacations and attend family reunions.\nLine 28, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Was your wife a spontaneous person or a planner?\nLine 29, 19:20:56: SJ: She was more spontaneous, always ready to take on new activities.\n--- End of Page 13 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 14 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Could you describe her for the jury?\nLine 2, 19:20:56: SJ: She is always happy, loves socializing and helping people. She attended choir rehearsal, Bible study\nLine 3, 19:20:56: every week, and also took care of our four children.\nLine 4, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: What was her job at the time of the crash?\nLine 5, 19:20:56: SJ: She was the assistant manager of a hair salon.\nLine 6, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Did she enjoy her work?\nLine 7, 19:20:56: SJ: Yes, she loved her work. It was part of her identity.\nLine 8, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Did your wife\u2019s demeanor change after the car accident?\nLine 9, 19:20:56: SJ: Yes, after the accident everything changed. Our family life and activity level changed significantly. She\nLine 10, 19:20:56: used to take the children to sporting events and practice basketball. Now, she can\u2019t do these activities.\nLine 11, 19:20:56: She no longer goes on family vacations. My two older sons call her \u201cboring\u201d now because of her reduced\nLine 12, 19:20:56: activity level. The accident has restricted her capabilities and as a result, she can\u2019t even do simple tasks\nLine 13, 19:20:56: like carrying laundry baskets or standing up to cook. Our family life has changed drastically since the\nLine 14, 19:20:56: accident.\nLine 15, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Has your wife gone back to work since the accident?\nLine 16, 19:20:56: SJ: She tried to help a friend out a couple of months ago at her hair salon, but it ended with her in a lot\nLine 17, 19:20:56: of pain due to the swelling in her ankle.\nLine 18, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: I have here a picture you received from your wife. Is this the picture she sent you?\nLine 19, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Can you tell us how your wife\u2019s personal social life has been affected since the crash?\nLine 20, 19:20:56: SJ: Her social life has indeed changed significantly. Before the accident, she would regularly go out with\nLine 21, 19:20:56: friends, engage in dancing, and other social activities. However, the constant pain and discomfort after\nLine 22, 19:20:56: the crash have made such activities impossible. Her social life is definitely not the same as before.\nLine 23, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: You mentioned earlier about her job. Was she able to resume work post the crash?\nLine 24, 19:20:56: SJ: She attempted to return to work, but the persistent pain made it unmanageable, particularly the\nLine 25, 19:20:56: long-standing hours. Eventually, she was forced to leave her job.\nLine 26, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: How has this situation impacted your family\u2019s finances?\nLine 27, 19:20:56: SJ: The impact has been substantial. She held the position of an assistant manager at a hair salon,\nLine 28, 19:20:56: bringing in a significant income. Now, with my single income, managing expenses for our four children\nLine 29, 19:20:56: and her medical bills has been strenuous.\nLine 30, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Besides the financial struggle, can you share how your relationship with your wife has\nLine 31, 19:20:56: evolved post the accident?\nLine 32, 19:20:56: SJ: Our relationship has undeniably been affected. She isn\u2019t the same person she was before the crash.\nLine 33, 19:20:56: Her constant pain and fatigue, coupled with frustration, have been hard on both of us.\nLine 34, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: And your children? How have they been coping with all these changes?\n--- End of Page 14 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 15 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:56: SJ: Our children have had to make significant adjustments. They miss the mother they had before the\nLine 2, 19:20:56: crash, not understanding why she can\u2019t engage in the activities she used to do with them. My older\nLine 3, 19:20:56: sons, in particular, have had to step up, assisting more with household chores. It\u2019s been a lot for them\nLine 4, 19:20:56: too.\nLine 5, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Finally, could you share your hopes for your wife\u2019s future?\nLine 6, 19:20:56: SJ: My biggest hope is for her to find relief from her pain and regain some semblance of normalcy. She\nLine 7, 19:20:56: deserves to live her life, not just endure it. It\u2019s challenging to see such a wonderful person go through\nLine 8, 19:20:56: this.

Do you\nLine 13, 19:20:56: have one?\nLine 14, 19:20:56: A: Indeed, we do have an exercise bike at home.\nLine 15, 19:20:56: Q: Did she frequently use the exercise bike, especially post-accident?\nLine 16, 19:20:56: A: Initially, during her therapy, they had her try riding the exercise bike.\nLine 17, 19:20:56: Q: Can you tell us what kind of exercises she did at home after the accident?\nLine 18, 19:20:56: A: She was given a chart with exercises, and I\u2019ve been helping her to flex her foot in both directions to\nLine 19, 19:20:56: try and loosen it up.\nLine 20, 19:20:56: Q: How long did this routine last?\nLine 21, 19:20:56: A: Actually, I still assist her with the foot exercises every night.\nLine 22, 19:20:56: Q: So you assist her based on the instructions from the chart?\nLine 23, 19:20:56: A: Not directly from the chart, but I\u2019ve learned the correct angles and try to flex her foot every night for\nLine 24, 19:20:56: her comfort and to aid her sleep.\nLine 25, 19:20:56: Q: Does she drive?\nLine 26, 19:20:56: A: Yes, she does.\nLine 27, 19:20:56: Q: Prior to the accident, she was employed full time?\nLine 28, 19:20:56: A: Yes, that\u2019s correct.\nLine 29, 19:20:56: Q: The jury was informed initially that she was also pursuing a degree?\nLine 30, 19:20:56: A: Yes, she was attending the University of Maryland.\nLine 31, 19:20:56: Q: Did she commute to the university?\nLine 32, 19:20:56: A: At certain points she did, but due to our four children, she primarily takes her classes online now.\n--- End of Page 15 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 16 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:56: Q: How close is she to obtaining her degree?\nLine 2, 19:20:56: A: She\u2019s expected to graduate within the next year.\nLine 3, 19:20:56: Court: Any redirect?\nLine 4, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: No further questions, Your Honor.\nLine 5, 19:20:56: Court: Thank you, sir, you may step down.

Ms. Miller, were you present at the intersection of Main Street and Maple\nLine 10, 19:01:36: Avenue on July 15th, 2023, at approximately 3:00 pm?\nLine 11, 19:01:36: Witness: Yes, I was. I was waiting at the red light on Maple Avenue, southbound, facing east.\nLine 12, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: Did you witness any accidents at that intersection at that time?\nLine 13, 19:01:36: Witness: Yes, I did. I saw a car traveling westbound on Main Street, which I believe was a blue sedan, run\nLine 14, 19:01:36: the red light and collide with a car traveling northbound on Maple Avenue, which I believe was a white\nLine 15, 19:01:36: SUV.\nLine 16, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: Can you describe the collision in more detail?\nLine 17, 19:01:36: Witness: The blue sedan seemed to be traveling at a high speed and didn't slow down or attempt to stop\nLine 18, 19:01:36: at the red light. It hit the white SUV directly on the driver's side. The impact was quite forceful, and both\nLine 19, 19:01:36: cars spun around significantly.\nLine 20, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: Ms. Miller, you mentioned the blue sedan was traveling at a high speed. How fast would you\nLine 21, 19:01:36: say it was going?\nLine 22, 19:01:36: Witness: It's difficult to say for sure, but it appeared to be going much faster than the posted speed\nLine 23, 19:01:36: limit, which is 35 miles per hour.\nLine 24, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: Did you see the driver of either vehicle at any point?\nLine 25, 19:01:36: Witness: No, I didn't.\nLine 26, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: Ms. Miller, did you notice anything unusual about the driver's behavior in the blue sedan\nLine 27, 19:01:36: before the accident?\nLine 28, 19:01:36: Witness: It's hard to say. Everything happened very quickly, but the car did seem to be swerving slightly\nLine 29, 19:01:36: just before the collision.\nLine 30, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: Ms. Miller, did you call the police or offer assistance to anyone involved in the accident?\nLine 31, 19:01:36: Witness: Yes, I immediately called 911 and stayed at the scene until the police arrived.\nLine 32, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: Did you speak to anyone else who may have witnessed the accident?\n--- End of Page 1 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 2 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:36: Witness: Yes, I exchanged information with another driver who was stopped next to me on Maple\nLine 2, 19:01:36: Avenue at the time.\nLine 3, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: Do you recall the make and model of the other vehicle that you spoke to?\nLine 4, 19:01:36: Witness: I believe it was a silver Toyota Camry, but I'm not entirely sure.\nLine 5, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: That's all my questions at this time.\nLine 6, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: I have no further questions\nLine 7, 19:01:36: Summary:\nLine 8, 19:01:36: The excerpt is from a legal deposition of Michael Anderson, who is under oath to tell the truth. Mr.\nLine 9, 19:01:36: Anderson confirms his employment at Acme Corporation as a graphic designer and details his job duties.\nLine 10, 19:01:36: He also confirms receiving positive performance reviews and never facing disciplinary actions. The\nLine 11, 19:01:36: excerpt ends with a question about witnessing or experiencing any discriminatory situations at Acme.\n--- End of Page 2 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 3 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:36: Deposition:\nLine 2, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Objection, that question calls for legal conclusions from the witness.\nLine 3, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: Withdrawn. Mr. Anderson, please describe any specific incidents or instances at Acme\nLine 4, 19:01:36: that involved your [protected category].\nLine 5, 19:01:36: Witness: There were several things that made me feel uncomfortable. During meetings, colleagues often\nLine 6, 19:01:36: talked over me or dismissed my ideas, particularly when compared to my younger male colleagues. I\nLine 7, 19:01:36: was also consistently passed over for promotions despite having experience and qualifications\nLine 8, 19:01:36: comparable to others who got promoted.\nLine 9, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you be specific about which colleagues treated you this way and provide\nLine 10, 19:01:36: specific examples of situations where these incidents occurred?\nLine 11, 19:01:36: Witness: One specific example would be the marketing campaign for the new product launch in 2023. I\nLine 12, 19:01:36: put significant effort into developing design concepts, but they were ultimately disregarded without any\nLine 13, 19:01:36: explanation. My male colleague's design, which was very similar to mine, was ultimately chosen.\nLine 14, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: Did you ever report any of these incidents to your supervisor or anyone else at Acme?\nLine 15, 19:01:36: Witness: I once mentioned feeling undervalued to my supervisor, but they brushed it off, suggesting I\nLine 16, 19:01:36: needed to \"work harder to prove myself.\" I wasn't comfortable bringing it up further after that.\nLine 17, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: Did you decide to leave Acme voluntarily, or were you terminated?\nLine 18, 19:01:36: Witness: When they announced another promotion I felt qualified for, but was once again passed over\nLine 19, 19:01:36: without explanation, I decided it was time to find a new position where I felt valued and respected.\nLine 20, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you confirm that your decision to leave Acme was solely based on not\nLine 21, 19:01:36: receiving the promotion, and not due to other factors like job performance or personal reasons?\nLine 22, 19:01:36: Witness: To the best of my knowledge, yes. It became clear to me that further advancement\nLine 23, 19:01:36: opportunities within the company were unlikely.\nLine 24, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: That's all my questions at this time.\nLine 25, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, during your time at Acme, did you ever receive any negative performance\nLine 26, 19:01:36: reviews or warnings related to your work performance?\nLine 27, 19:01:36: Witness: No, as mentioned before, my performance reviews were always positive.\nLine 28, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Did you ever attend any diversity and inclusion training offered by Acme during your\nLine 29, 19:01:36: employment?\nLine 30, 19:01:36: Witness: I did participate in the mandatory online training modules, but there weren't any specific\nLine 31, 19:01:36: training sessions related to addressing or reporting potentially discriminatory situations within the\nLine 32, 19:01:36: company.\nLine 33, 19:01:36: Summary\n--- End of Page 3 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 4 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:36: Michael Anderson details specific incidents supporting his feeling of being undervalued based on his\nLine 2, 19:01:36: protected category. He describes colleagues disregarding his ideas and being passed over for\nLine 3, 19:01:36: promotions despite comparable qualifications. He provides a specific example from the 2023 product\nLine 4, 19:01:36: launch where his design was overlooked in favor of a male colleague's similar work. He mentions\nLine 5, 19:01:36: mentioning his concerns to his supervisor but being discouraged from pursuing them. He clarifies his\nLine 6, 19:01:36: decision to leave Acme was due to the lack of advancement opportunities, not performance or personal\nLine 7, 19:01:36: reasons. Ms. Garcia then establishes that Mr. Anderson's performance was consistently good and that\nLine 8, 19:01:36: he participated in available diversity training while at Acme, though specific training for addressing\nLine 9, 19:01:36: potential discrimination was absent.\nLine 10, 19:01:36: Deposition:\nLine 11, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, are you aware of Acme's anti-discrimination policy or how complaints of\nLine 12, 19:01:36: discrimination are addressed within the company?\nLine 13, 19:01:36: Witness: I reviewed the employee handbook, which did explain the existence of an anti-discrimination\nLine 14, 19:01:36: policy. However, I was unsure of the specific complaint process at the time\nLine 15, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you elaborate on why you felt apprehensive about bringing up these\nLine 16, 19:01:36: incidents to your supervisor despite feeling uncomfortable and undervalued?\nLine 17, 19:01:36: Witness: Honestly, there were a few reasons. Firstly, as I mentioned, when I did hint at feeling\nLine 18, 19:01:36: undervalued to my supervisor, their dismissive response discouraged me from further discussions. It\nLine 19, 19:01:36: seemed like they weren't receptive to hearing about any potential issues.\nLine 20, 19:01:36: Secondly, there was a general company culture that made me hesitant to speak up. Younger male\nLine 21, 19:01:36: colleagues often dominated conversations and presentations, and there weren't many women in senior\nLine 22, 19:01:36: positions within the marketing department. It felt like my voice wouldn't be heard or even worse, that\nLine 23, 19:01:36: bringing forward complaints might lead to retaliation or hinder my career further.\nLine 24, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Did you notice any specific instances of retaliation against other employees who may have\nLine 25, 19:01:36: raised complaints or concerns about work environment issues?\nLine 26, 19:01:36: Witness: While I can't say for sure, there was one colleague, Sarah Lopez, who openly challenged gender\nLine 27, 19:01:36: bias during a department meeting but was subsequently given less desirable project assignments\nLine 28, 19:01:36: compared to her male colleagues. This incident definitely reinforced my concerns about potentially\nLine 29, 19:01:36: facing a similar situation.**\nLine 30, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: Objection, speculation about an unrelated case is irrelevant to the present matter.\nLine 31, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Withdrawn. Mr. Anderson, did you ever discuss your concerns about potential bias or lack of\nLine 32, 19:01:36: promotion opportunities with any human resources personnel at Acme?\nLine 33, 19:01:36: Witness: No, I didn't. As I mentioned before, the lack of clarity on the specific complaint process\nLine 34, 19:01:36: combined with the overall culture discouraged me from pursuing that route.\nLine 35, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, since leaving Acme, have you sought employment elsewhere?\n--- End of Page 4 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 5 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, I am currently employed at a different company and feel much more valued and respected\nLine 2, 19:01:37: in my current role. The work environment is significantly more inclusive, and I regularly receive positive\nLine 3, 19:01:37: feedback and opportunities for professional development.\nLine 4, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, how has your experience at Acme impacted you personally and\nLine 5, 19:01:37: professionally?\nLine 6, 19:01:37: Witness: It was definitely a frustrating and discouraging experience. It felt like my hard work and\nLine 7, 19:01:37: qualifications weren't being recognized fairly, leading to some self-doubt and a sense of being\nLine 8, 19:01:37: undervalued. However, finding a new and positive work environment has helped me rebuild my\nLine 9, 19:01:37: confidence and refocus on my career goals.\nLine 10, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: I have no further questions.\nLine 11, 19:01:37: Summary\nLine 12, 19:01:37: This segment explores Mr. Anderson's reasons for not formally complaining despite feeling undervalued.\nLine 13, 19:01:37: He reiterates his supervisor's dismissive response and the perceived lack of receptiveness within the\nLine 14, 19:01:37: company culture. He describes a specific instance where a colleague who challenged gender bias faced\nLine 15, 19:01:37: negative consequences, reinforcing his fear of retaliation. He clarifies that he didn't pursue HR due to\nLine 16, 19:01:37: unclear procedures and the discouraging company culture. Finally, he highlights his positive experience\nLine 17, 19:01:37: at a new company, emphasizing feelings of value, inclusion, and professional growth in contrast to his\nLine 18, 19:01:37: experience at Acme. He concludes by acknowledging the frustration and self-doubt from Acme but also\nLine 19, 19:01:37: the positive impact of finding a supportive work environment.\nLine 20, 19:01:37: Deposition\nLine 21, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: I have one final question. Mr. Anderson, is there anything else you would like to add\nLine 22, 19:01:37: regarding your experience at Acme Corporation?\nLine 23, 19:01:37: Witness: Just that I hope by sharing my story, it can contribute to fostering a more diverse and inclusive\nLine 24, 19:01:37: work environment at Acme for future employees. Everyone deserves to feel valued and respected in\nLine 25, 19:01:37: their workplace, regardless of their [protected category].\nLine 26, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Interesting point, Mr. Anderson. Ms. Garcia, while you have no further questions, I'd like\nLine 27, 19:01:37: to explore some aspects of Mr. Anderson's experience further before concluding the deposition.\nLine 28, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: No objection. Please proceed, Mr. Thompson.\nLine 29, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, you mentioned feeling unsure about the specific complaint process at\nLine 30, 19:01:37: Acme. Did you take any steps to learn more about it after your meeting with your supervisor?\nLine 31, 19:01:37: Witness: No, I didn't feel comfortable approaching my supervisor again after their dismissive response.\nLine 32, 19:01:37: Additionally, I recall the employee handbook being quite lengthy, and finding specific information about\nLine 33, 19:01:37: the complaint process proved difficult at the time.\n--- End of Page 5 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 6 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: You mentioned a colleague, Sarah Lopez, who voiced concerns about gender bias. Did\nLine 2, 19:01:37: you ever speak to her directly about her experience and the alleged retaliation she faced?\nLine 3, 19:01:37: Witness: Briefly, yes. We expressed our mutual frustrations and the feeling of being undervalued within\nLine 4, 19:01:37: the department. However, we were both hesitant to pursue any formal complaints due to the\nLine 5, 19:01:37: aforementioned concerns about the company culture and potential retaliation.\nLine 6, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Did you ever discuss the issue of lack of promotion opportunities with any other\nLine 7, 19:01:37: colleagues, particularly women in the marketing department?\nLine 8, 19:01:37: Witness: Not directly. While there were a few women colleagues in the department, none of them were\nLine 9, 19:01:37: in senior positions. The general environment discouraged open communication about potentially\nLine 10, 19:01:37: sensitive topics like discrimination.\nLine 11, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Thompson, I object to leading the witness. Can you rephrase your question and allow\nLine 12, 19:01:37: Mr. Anderson to answer in his own words?\nLine 13, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Apologies, Ms. Garcia. Mr. Anderson, to clarify, did you have any informal conversations\nLine 14, 19:01:37: with other colleagues about your concerns regarding promotion opportunities or potential gender bias\nLine 15, 19:01:37: within the marketing department at Acme?\nLine 16, 19:01:37: Witness: There weren't any specific discussions about promotions or bias, but the general atmosphere\nLine 17, 19:01:37: around the lack of female representation in senior positions was a frequent topic of quiet observation\nLine 18, 19:01:37: amongst some female colleagues. We felt implicit pressure to work harder and prove ourselves more\nLine 19, 19:01:37: than our male colleagues, but reaching leadership positions seemed like an increasingly distant\nLine 20, 19:01:37: prospect.\nLine 21, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you elaborate on what kind of \"pressure\" you felt, and was there any\nLine 22, 19:01:37: specific instance or behavior from colleagues or superiors that made you feel this way?\nLine 23, 19:01:37: Summary\nLine 24, 19:01:37: In the concluding segment, Mr. Anderson expresses hope that his experience can contribute to a more\nLine 25, 19:01:37: inclusive work environment at Acme. Mr. Thompson then delves deeper into specific aspects of Mr.\nLine 26, 19:01:37: Anderson's experience:\nLine 27, 19:01:37: Complaint process: Mr. Anderson cites discomfort following his supervisor's reaction and difficulty\nLine 28, 19:01:37: navigating the lengthy employee handbook as reasons for not seeking further information.\nLine 29, 19:01:37: Colleague's experience: He mentions briefly discussing his frustrations and concerns with Sarah Lopez\nLine 30, 19:01:37: but clarifies their shared hesitation to pursue formal complaints due to company culture concerns.\nLine 31, 19:01:37: Promotion opportunities and gender bias: He explains the lack of open communication about these\nLine 32, 19:01:37: issues and feeling unspoken pressure due to the absence of women in senior positions, though no\nLine 33, 19:01:37: specific discussions on bias occurred.\nLine 34, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia objects to a leading question about bias, and Mr. Thompson rephrases, allowing Mr.\nLine 35, 19:01:37: Anderson to clarify further. He explains the silent observation among female colleagues of the lack of\n--- End of Page 6 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 7 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:37: female leadership and the perceived need to overachieve compared to male colleagues. Ms. Garcia\nLine 2, 19:01:37: requests further details about the pressure felt by Mr. Anderson.\nLine 3, 19:01:37: Deposition\nLine 4, 19:01:37: Witness: It wasn't any direct confrontation or statement, but more of a subtle feeling arising from\nLine 5, 19:01:37: observing the lack of female representation in leadership roles combined with certain comments about\nLine 6, 19:01:37: needing to \"work harder\" or \"prove myself\" despite my consistent positive performance reviews.\nLine 7, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Thank you, Mr. Anderson. These are valuable insights. Do you have any further\nLine 8, 19:01:37: questions, Ms. Garcia?\nLine 9, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: (after reviewing her notes) I have a few follow-up questions for clarification. However, due\nLine 10, 19:01:37: to the time constraints, I would like to schedule a follow-up session at your earliest convenience, Mr.\nLine 11, 19:01:37: Thompson, to continue exploring specific details and potential evidence.\nLine 12, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: No objection. Mr. Anderson, are you available for a follow-up session within the next\nLine 13, 19:01:37: week?\nLine 14, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, I am available. Please let me know the details when you've scheduled it\nLine 15, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, since our last session, have you had any time to review Acme\nLine 16, 19:01:37: Corporation's employee handbook pertaining to the complaint process for potential discrimination?\nLine 17, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, I have.\nLine 18, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Can you briefly describe the steps outlined in the handbook for filing a complaint based\nLine 19, 19:01:37: on potential discrimination?\nLine 20, 19:01:37: Witness: The handbook mentioned employees could submit a written complaint to the Human\nLine 21, 19:01:37: Resources department or verbally report it to an HR representative or any manager. However, specific\nLine 22, 19:01:37: details about the investigation process or resolution options were quite vague.\nLine 23, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, did the employee handbook specify who constitutes a \"manager\" authorized\nLine 24, 19:01:37: to receive such initial verbal complaints?\nLine 25, 19:01:37: Witness: No, it didn't provide any specific details about which managers were included in that definition\nLine 26, 19:01:37: or if all managers were authorized to receive such reports.\nLine 27, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, you previously mentioned frustration with receiving similar design\nLine 28, 19:01:37: concepts to yours being chosen over your own work while working at Acme. Do you still have copies of\nLine 29, 19:01:37: these original design concepts and the final versions ultimately used?\nLine 30, 19:01:37: Witness: Unfortunately, I didn't retain individual copies of every design iteration. However, I did\nLine 31, 19:01:37: maintain some preliminary sketches and digital drafts from several projects, including the one discussed\nLine 32, 19:01:37: earlier related to the 2023 product launch campaign.\nLine 33, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Would you be willing to provide these materials as potential evidence in this case?\nLine 34, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, I can bring them to the next session.\n--- End of Page 7 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 8 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, are you aware of other colleagues who may have retained copies of their\nLine 2, 19:01:37: rejected design projects or drafts during their employment at Acme?\nLine 3, 19:01:37: Witness: I'm not certain, but I remember several colleagues raising concerns about the inconsistent\nLine 4, 19:01:37: feedback and selection process for design concepts. It's possible some of them might have kept records\nLine 5, 19:01:37: for their own reference.\nLine 6, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: We will look into that possibility. Mr. Anderson, during your time at Acme, did you ever\nLine 7, 19:01:37: meet or hear about any employees who filed official complaints based on experiencing discrimination?\nLine 8, 19:01:37: Witness: Not officially. As mentioned earlier, there was an underlying lack of transparency and open\nLine 9, 19:01:37: communication around potentially sensitive topics like discrimination. Therefore, it was difficult to know\nLine 10, 19:01:37: for sure.\nLine 11, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, did you receive any additional training or workshops related to diversity and\nLine 12, 19:01:37: inclusion since leaving Acme Corporation?\nLine 13, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, my current employer offers comprehensive training programs and workshops regarding\nLine 14, 19:01:37: diversity and inclusion as part of their ongoing commitment to a fair and equitable work environment.\nLine 15, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Do you find these additional training programs and the overall work environment at\nLine 16, 19:01:37: your current company to be beneficial compared to your experience at Acme?\nLine 17, 19:01:37: Witness: Absolutely. The focus on creating a safe space for open communication, valuing diverse\nLine 18, 19:01:37: perspectives, and providing equal opportunities for growth has been incredibly positive and\nLine 19, 19:01:37: empowering.\nLine 20, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: No further questions at this time.\nLine 21, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, as mentioned previously, we would like you to bring copies of the design\nLine 22, 19:01:37: materials you retained for the next session. Additionally, I may reach out to inquire about potential\nLine 23, 19:01:37: colleagues who might have kept similar records. Is that alright?\nLine 24, 19:01:37: Witness: That's perfectly fine. Please let me know if you need anything else in the meantime.\nLine 25, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, one final question before we adjourn. You mentioned feeling hesitant to\nLine 26, 19:01:37: bring up your concerns to your supervisor after their dismissive response. Did their reaction specifically\nLine 27, 19:01:37: mention any consequences of raising the potential bias issue?\nLine 28, 19:01:37: Witness: Not directly. There wasn't an explicit threat of any sort. However, their dismissive tone and the\nLine 29, 19:01:37: implication that my concerns weren't valid created an atmosphere where I felt further discussion would\nLine 30, 19:01:37: be futile and potentially disadvantageous.\nLine 31, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Objection, speculation about the witness's interpretation of a supervisor's tone is not based\nLine 32, 19:01:37: on facts.\nLine 33, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Reframing, Mr. Anderson. How did your supervisor's response make you feel about the\nLine 34, 19:01:37: potential consequences of reporting your concerns?\n--- End of Page 8 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 9 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:38: Witness: Their response discouraged me and made me feel unheard. It conveyed the impression that my\nLine 2, 19:01:38: concerns about potential bias wouldn't be taken seriously and could potentially hinder my career\nLine 3, 19:01:38: progression within the company.\nLine 4, 19:01:38: Summary\nLine 5, 19:01:38: The concluding segment addresses further details and sets the stage for a follow-up session:\nLine 6, 19:01:38: Complaint process: Mr. Anderson reviews the handbook and describes the outlined steps for filing a\nLine 7, 19:01:38: complaint, noting the vagueness regarding investigation and resolution. Ms. Garcia highlights the lack of\nLine 8, 19:01:38: clarity on who qualifies as a \"manager\" authorized to receive initial verbal reports.\nLine 9, 19:01:38: Design concepts: Mr. Anderson clarifies he still possesses some preliminary sketches and drafts,\nLine 10, 19:01:38: including those from the 2023 product launch, and agrees to provide them as potential evidence. Mr.\nLine 11, 19:01:38: Thompson expresses interest in exploring the possibility of other colleagues retaining similar materials.\nLine 12, 19:01:38: Official complaints: Mr. Anderson reiterates the lack of knowledge about any official discrimination\nLine 13, 19:01:38: complaints at Acme due to the previously mentioned culture of secrecy.\nLine 14, 19:01:38: Current company: Mr. Anderson confirms receiving additional diversity and inclusion training at his\nLine 15, 19:01:38: current company. He emphasizes the positive aspects of his new work environment, highlighting open\nLine 16, 19:01:38: communication, valuing diverse perspectives, and equal opportunities, contrasting it with his experience\nLine 17, 19:01:38: at Acme.\nLine 18, 19:01:38: Follow-up: Both parties agree to a follow-up session. Mr. Thompson clarifies his intention to request the\nLine 19, 19:01:38: design materials and potentially contact other colleagues. Ms. Garcia objects to the witness's\nLine 20, 19:01:38: interpretation of his supervisor's tone, leading Mr. Thompson to rephrase the question, to which Mr.\nLine 21, 19:01:38: Anderson reiterates feeling discouraged and unheard, fearing his concerns wouldn't be taken seriously\nLine 22, 19:01:38: and could hinder his career.\nLine 23, 19:01:38: Deposition\nLine 24, 19:01:38: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Thompson, I believe we've covered the essential topics for today. However, as these are\nLine 25, 19:01:38: complex claims, I would appreciate the opportunity to review the transcript and potentially ask further\nLine 26, 19:01:38: questions at a future session, should any need arise.\nLine 27, 19:01:38: Mr. Thompson: No objection. Mr. Anderson, as Ms. Garcia mentioned, we appreciate your willingness to\nLine 28, 19:01:38: cooperate and provide additional materials. We will be in touch to schedule a follow-up session if\nLine 29, 19:01:38: needed.\nLine 30, 19:01:38: Witness: Understood.\nLine 31, 19:01:38: Summary\nLine 32, 19:01:38: The deposition concludes with Ms. Garcia expressing a desire to review the transcript and potentially\nLine 33, 19:01:38: ask further questions in a future session if needed. Mr. Thompson agrees, and both thank Mr. Anderson\nLine 34, 19:01:38: for his cooperation and willingness to provide additional materials. Mr. Anderson acknowledges their\nLine 35, 19:01:38: communication and awaits further information regarding a potential follow-up session.\n--- End of Page 9 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 10 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:38: Deposition\nLine 2, 19:01:38: MILLER: A driver is obligated to pay attention to the road and yield to other drivers when required. Let\nLine 3, 19:01:38: me take you back to what happened on April 20th, 2022. The Defendant, who was an attorney for the\nLine 4, 19:01:38: IRS, was driving her usual route to work. She drove down Annapolis Road to take a left onto another\nLine 5, 19:01:38: road.\nLine 6, 19:01:38: (Could we have the next slide, please?) She was driving down this road\u2026 can everyone see this? She\nLine 7, 19:01:38: stopped at a light on a clear day. While stopped, she reached down to find her parking pass.\nLine 8, 19:01:38: DEFENSE LAWYER: May we approach?\nLine 9, 19:01:38: THE COURT: Yes.\nLine 10, 19:01:38: BENCH CONFERENCE\nLine 11, 19:01:38: (Bench Conference begins \u2013 10:26:39m.)\nLine 12, 19:01:38: (The parties approach the bench for a discussion.)\nLine 13, 19:01:38: THE COURT: By court ruling, liability has been established. The focus of this case is only on damages. I\nLine 14, 19:01:38: understand why we\u2019re discussing these details, but it\u2019s about damages.\nLine 15, 19:01:38: MILLER: I\u2019m setting the scene for the accident because her damages are part of the accident narrative.\nLine 16, 19:01:38: DEFENSE LAWYER: We\u2019re only discussing the fact that an accident happened and a person was injured.\nLine 17, 19:01:38: The details about reaching and negligence seem to be evidence of liability.\nLine 18, 19:01:38: THE COURT: I understand. It\u2019s your opening statement, so I\u2019ll give you some leeway.\nLine 19, 19:01:38: MILLER: I\u2019m just providing context. I\u2019ll be getting into the damages soon.\nLine 20, 19:01:38: THE COURT: Alright.\nLine 21, 19:01:38: (Bench Conference concluded \u2013 10:27:32 m.)\nLine 22, 19:01:38: (The parties return to their places.)\nLine 23, 19:01:38: MILLER: The Defendant heard a horn beep and took a left turn. She didn\u2019t see the Plaintiff, who had the\nLine 24, 19:01:38: right of way, coming from the opposite direction. Due to the collision, the Plaintiff\u2019s ankle was broken\nLine 25, 19:01:38: and required surgery.\nLine 26, 19:01:38: Take a look at these images. The first one shows her ankle before surgery, the second one after surgery.\nLine 27, 19:01:38: Today, she still has 15 screws and three plates in her ankle. She will never be able to run again and\nLine 28, 19:01:38: standing for extended periods of time is difficult.\nLine 29, 19:01:38: We\u2019ve brought this case before you because of the harm caused to the Plaintiff. We needed to agree\nLine 30, 19:01:38: that the Defendant was at fault for the accident, which she has accepted. We also had to understand the\nLine 31, 19:01:38: extent and implications of the Plaintiff\u2019s damages, not just the initial injury and surgery, but also its long-\nLine 32, 19:01:38: term impact on her life.\nLine 33, 19:01:38: To do this, we spoke to her doctors, her husband, her friends, and even her employer. One of her\nLine 34, 19:01:38: doctors is going to talk to you.\n--- End of Page 10 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 11 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:38: This is the guy to see if something awful like this is going to happen to your ankle. He received an Ivy\nLine 2, 19:01:38: League education and, at one point, was the chief of foot and ankle orthopedic injuries at Johns\nLine 3, 19:01:38: Hopkins. He consults for the Baltimore Orioles. His resume, I want to say, is as long as your arm, but it\u2019s\nLine 4, 19:01:38: actually a lot longer than that.\nLine 5, 19:01:38: We\u2019re going to bring him to talk to you guys, in a very 2023 way. It\u2019s going to be by videotape, so his\nLine 6, 19:01:38: testimony will be by videotape, but it holds the same force as if it was at trial, and he came here to see\nLine 7, 19:01:38: us. And, of course, my partner Laura Zois and the defense attorney had an opportunity to ask him\nLine 8, 19:01:38: questions.\nLine 9, 19:01:38: He\u2019s going to tell you she still has 15 screws and three plates in her ankle holding everything together.\nLine 10, 19:01:38: The problem with that is that it creates a breeding ground for arthritis, and this 33-year-old woman\nLine 11, 19:01:38: already has the signs of arthritis. At some point, she\u2019s going to need what\u2019s called a fusion, which will\nLine 12, 19:01:38: stabilize her ankle. The bad news is, you can\u2019t move it once it locks, so you no longer have the ability to\nLine 13, 19:01:38: bend.\nLine 14, 19:01:38: This trial is about the harms and losses that she has suffered and endured as the result of this accident.\nLine 15, 19:01:38: This is not a case about sympathy. You should not award her damages because you feel sorry for her.\nLine 16, 19:01:38: You\u2019re going to hear about how the accident has impacted her professional and personal life.\nLine 17, 19:01:38: At the time of the crash, they were a very young family. They were an energetic family. This is an active\nLine 18, 19:01:38: family with four kids doing everything you can imagine, Six Flags, the park. They would run together.\nLine 19, 19:01:38: They played basketball together. They traveled everywhere, New York, Baltimore, Washington, DC. They\nLine 20, 19:01:38: were just a very active family.\nLine 21, 19:01:38: And she also had a vibrant social life. She was a hairstylist, and she loved that job. It was her social outlet\nLine 22, 19:01:38: beside her kids. She would do the church choir every Wednesday, and still found times to go out and see\nLine 23, 19:01:38: her family. She\u2019s still fighting with her family, but it\u2019s hard.\nLine 24, 19:01:38: She can\u2019t work as a hairstylist anymore. So what did she do? She went back to school to the University\nLine 25, 19:01:38: of Maryland. She\u2019s working, getting very close to getting her degree. She\u2019s still fighting. She has four kids\nLine 26, 19:01:38: they\u2019re chasing around.\nLine 27, 19:01:38: Let\u2019s go back and talk about how it ended up. Let\u2019s talk about the accident. She had this awful crash and\nLine 28, 19:01:38: needed emergency surgery where they put in these screws. She had a nine-month-old baby, along with\nLine 29, 19:01:38: three other kids. She and the two girls, the younger ones, went to live with her mom. Her mom took\nLine 30, 19:01:38: care of her and the girls, while her husband took care of the other kids.\nLine 31, 19:01:38: This has been a massive disruption to their lives. The accident has completely changed her life, and it\u2019s\nLine 32, 19:01:38: reflected in every facet of her day-to-day. Her job, her family life, her hobbies, everything she used to\nLine 33, 19:01:38: take pleasure in has been impacted in one way or another. And the evidence in this case will show these\nLine 34, 19:01:38: changes are likely to persist for the rest of her life.\nLine 35, 19:01:38: We ask you to consider the totality of these changes, the persistent harm and loss she\u2019s suffered and\nLine 36, 19:01:38: will continue to suffer, as a direct result of the accident. We ask you to consider these when coming to a\nLine 37, 19:01:38: decision in this case.\n--- End of Page 11 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 12 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:38: This accident, however, led to an upheaval in their lives. About a month after the accident, she managed\nLine 2, 19:01:38: to return home with the kids. Her mother, an FDA employee, took three months off work to care for her,\nLine 3, 19:01:38: her daughter, and her grandchildren. The accident wreaked havoc on their lives.\nLine 4, 19:01:38: She endured six months of rigorous physical therapy and another operation. While it was painful and\nLine 5, 19:01:38: difficult, the effort was worthwhile as it improved her condition, especially her ankle, though we wish\nLine 6, 19:01:38: she had recovered more.\nLine 7, 19:01:38: As we delve into this case, it\u2019s about the harm and losses experienced. We will ask you to make amends\nLine 8, 19:01:38: where possible and provide compensation for the irreparable harm. The damages can be categorized\nLine 9, 19:01:38: into three parts: her medical bills, the post-accident trauma suffered by her and her family, and the pain\nLine 10, 19:01:38: she will endure for the expected next 45 years of her life.\nLine 11, 19:01:38: She was a spontaneous person, fond of making impromptu plans like going to Virginia Beach over the\nLine 12, 19:01:38: weekend or heading to the park. Now, every activity revolves around her ability to reach there, her\nLine 13, 19:01:38: mobility, and whether she can tolerate the pain during the trip. This situation has affected her and her\nLine 14, 19:01:38: four kids, as well as her husband.\nLine 15, 19:01:38: The court wants to clarify that the evidence and testimonies from the witness stand are what will\nLine 16, 19:01:38: control your deliberations. Opening statements and closing arguments of lawyers do not constitute\nLine 17, 19:01:38: evidence.\nLine 18, 19:01:38: This case is not just about the suffering of their children or her husband. It\u2019s about the impact of their\nLine 19, 19:01:38: suffering on her. We will ask you to consider an amount that may seem high at the beginning. But we\nLine 20, 19:01:38: believe that after hearing all the evidence, you\u2019ll find it to be a fair compensation for her losses and\nLine 21, 19:01:38: harm. The amount we suggest is $1.1 million.\nLine 22, 19:01:38: Defense Opening Statement\nLine 23, 19:01:38: Regarding the defendant, they acknowledge the responsibility for the accident and that it was their\nLine 24, 19:01:38: fault. The case is for you to determine the appropriate damages. The injury is severe, and they ask for an\nLine 25, 19:01:38: extraordinary amount of compensation.\nLine 26, 19:01:38: She broke her ankle, which was repaired surgically with plates and screws. There was a second surgery\nLine 27, 19:01:38: due to loosening of the screws, which were then removed. She attended physical therapy, which\nLine 28, 19:01:38: improved her ability to move her ankle. Whether she will need surgery in the future is uncertain.\nLine 29, 19:01:38: The past medical expenses are around $36,505, which we don\u2019t contest. Her lost wages due to the\nLine 30, 19:01:38: accident are around $3,400 to $3,500. These are not the focal points of this case. The main issue is the\nLine 31, 19:01:38: amount to be awarded for non-economic damages, for which we request something fair, reasonable,\nLine 32, 19:01:38: and sensible.\nLine 33, 19:01:38: Thank you for your time and attention, and we hope to conclude this case promptly.\nLine 34, 19:01:38: Testimony of Victim\u2019s Husband\nLine 35, 19:01:38: Mr. Miller: Good morning. Can I have your address?\nLine 36, 19:01:38: SJ: Certainly.\nLine 37, 19:01:38: Mr. Miller: How long have you lived at that address?\n--- End of Page 12 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 13 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: SJ: I bought the house in 2003, so it\u2019s been approximately ten years.\nLine 2, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Who lives there with you?\nLine 3, 19:01:39: SJ: My wife, and our four children.\nLine 4, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Can you tell the jury how old your children are and their names?\nLine 5, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes. My children are 13, and the others are\u2026\nLine 6, 19:01:39: The Honorable Judge: Please continue.\nLine 7, 19:01:39: SJ: \u2026five, and three.\nLine 8, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: I understand. And for some background, what do you do for a living?\nLine 9, 19:01:39: SJ: I\u2019m currently the general manager at Oreck Clean Home Center.\nLine 10, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: And where are these locations?\nLine 11, 19:01:39: SJ: We have six locations in Maryland and Virginia.\nLine 12, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: What are your responsibilities at work?\nLine 13, 19:01:39: SJ: I oversee all six stores and manage one of them.\nLine 14, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Can you describe your work schedule?\nLine 15, 19:01:39: SJ: I work Monday through Saturday, from 10:00 am to 7:00 pm. Often, I work seven days a week which\nLine 16, 19:01:39: means working on Sundays from 12:00 pm to 5:00 pm.\nLine 17, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: How do you feel about those hours?\nLine 18, 19:01:39: SJ: They are long, but I need to work to support my family.\nLine 19, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: How long have you known your wife?\nLine 20, 19:01:39: SJ: I met her in 1993, she was my sister\u2019s best friend.\nLine 21, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: You mean your wife was your sister\u2019s best friend?\nLine 22, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes, I apologize for the confusion. She was indeed my sister\u2019s best friend.\nLine 23, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Let\u2019s move to another topic. Do you remember the car accident your wife was in 2022?\nLine 24, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes, I do.\nLine 25, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Prior to the accident, can you describe your household?\nLine 26, 19:01:39: SJ: Our household was what I would consider the perfect life. My wife and children were happy and\nLine 27, 19:01:39: always engaged in activities. We used to take vacations and attend family reunions.\nLine 28, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Was your wife a spontaneous person or a planner?\nLine 29, 19:01:39: SJ: She was more spontaneous, always ready to take on new activities.\n--- End of Page 13 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 14 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Could you describe her for the jury?\nLine 2, 19:01:39: SJ: She is always happy, loves socializing and helping people. She attended choir rehearsal, Bible study\nLine 3, 19:01:39: every week, and also took care of our four children.\nLine 4, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: What was her job at the time of the crash?\nLine 5, 19:01:39: SJ: She was the assistant manager of a hair salon.\nLine 6, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Did she enjoy her work?\nLine 7, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes, she loved her work. It was part of her identity.\nLine 8, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Did your wife\u2019s demeanor change after the car accident?\nLine 9, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes, after the accident everything changed. Our family life and activity level changed significantly. She\nLine 10, 19:01:39: used to take the children to sporting events and practice basketball. Now, she can\u2019t do these activities.\nLine 11, 19:01:39: She no longer goes on family vacations. My two older sons call her \u201cboring\u201d now because of her reduced\nLine 12, 19:01:39: activity level. The accident has restricted her capabilities and as a result, she can\u2019t even do simple tasks\nLine 13, 19:01:39: like carrying laundry baskets or standing up to cook. Our family life has changed drastically since the\nLine 14, 19:01:39: accident.\nLine 15, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Has your wife gone back to work since the accident?\nLine 16, 19:01:39: SJ: She tried to help a friend out a couple of months ago at her hair salon, but it ended with her in a lot\nLine 17, 19:01:39: of pain due to the swelling in her ankle.\nLine 18, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: I have here a picture you received from your wife. Is this the picture she sent you?\nLine 19, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Can you tell us how your wife\u2019s personal social life has been affected since the crash?\nLine 20, 19:01:39: SJ: Her social life has indeed changed significantly. Before the accident, she would regularly go out with\nLine 21, 19:01:39: friends, engage in dancing, and other social activities. However, the constant pain and discomfort after\nLine 22, 19:01:39: the crash have made such activities impossible. Her social life is definitely not the same as before.\nLine 23, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: You mentioned earlier about her job. Was she able to resume work post the crash?\nLine 24, 19:01:39: SJ: She attempted to return to work, but the persistent pain made it unmanageable, particularly the\nLine 25, 19:01:39: long-standing hours. Eventually, she was forced to leave her job.\nLine 26, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: How has this situation impacted your family\u2019s finances?\nLine 27, 19:01:39: SJ: The impact has been substantial. She held the position of an assistant manager at a hair salon,\nLine 28, 19:01:39: bringing in a significant income. Now, with my single income, managing expenses for our four children\nLine 29, 19:01:39: and her medical bills has been strenuous.\nLine 30, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Besides the financial struggle, can you share how your relationship with your wife has\nLine 31, 19:01:39: evolved post the accident?\nLine 32, 19:01:39: SJ: Our relationship has undeniably been affected. She isn\u2019t the same person she was before the crash.\nLine 33, 19:01:39: Her constant pain and fatigue, coupled with frustration, have been hard on both of us.\nLine 34, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: And your children? How have they been coping with all these changes?\n--- End of Page 14 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 15 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: SJ: Our children have had to make significant adjustments. They miss the mother they had before the\nLine 2, 19:01:39: crash, not understanding why she can\u2019t engage in the activities she used to do with them. My older\nLine 3, 19:01:39: sons, in particular, have had to step up, assisting more with household chores. It\u2019s been a lot for them\nLine 4, 19:01:39: too.\nLine 5, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Finally, could you share your hopes for your wife\u2019s future?\nLine 6, 19:01:39: SJ: My biggest hope is for her to find relief from her pain and regain some semblance of normalcy. She\nLine 7, 19:01:39: deserves to live her life, not just endure it. It\u2019s challenging to see such a wonderful person go through\nLine 8, 19:01:39: this. We are taking each day as it comes, hoping for a better future.\nLine 9, 19:01:39: Defense Attorney Cross Examination of Victim\u2019s Husband\nLine 10, 19:01:39: Q: Regarding the foot stretching exercises, you assist her with those?\nLine 11, 19:01:39: A: Yes, I do.\nLine 12, 19:01:39: Q: Looking through her medical records, I noticed there\u2019s mention of an exercise bike at home. Do you\nLine 13, 19:01:39: have one?\nLine 14, 19:01:39: A: Indeed, we do have an exercise bike at home.\nLine 15, 19:01:39: Q: Did she frequently use the exercise bike, especially post-accident?\nLine 16, 19:01:39: A: Initially, during her therapy, they had her try riding the exercise bike.\nLine 17, 19:01:39: Q: Can you tell us what kind of exercises she did at home after the accident?\nLine 18, 19:01:39: A: She was given a chart with exercises, and I\u2019ve been helping her to flex her foot in both directions to\nLine 19, 19:01:39: try and loosen it up.\nLine 20, 19:01:39: Q: How long did this routine last?\nLine 21, 19:01:39: A: Actually, I still assist her with the foot exercises every night.\nLine 22, 19:01:39: Q: So you assist her based on the instructions from the chart?\nLine 23, 19:01:39: A: Not directly from the chart, but I\u2019ve learned the correct angles and try to flex her foot every night for\nLine 24, 19:01:39: her comfort and to aid her sleep.\nLine 25, 19:01:39: Q: Does she drive?\nLine 26, 19:01:39: A: Yes, she does.\nLine 27, 19:01:39: Q: Prior to the accident, she was employed full time?\nLine 28, 19:01:39: A: Yes, that\u2019s correct.\nLine 29, 19:01:39: Q: The jury was informed initially that she was also pursuing a degree?\nLine 30, 19:01:39: A: Yes, she was attending the University of Maryland.\nLine 31, 19:01:39: Q: Did she commute to the university?\nLine 32, 19:01:39: A: At certain points she did, but due to our four children, she primarily takes her classes online now.\n--- End of Page 15 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 16 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: Q: How close is she to obtaining her degree?\nLine 2, 19:01:39: A: She\u2019s expected to graduate within the next year.\nLine 3, 19:01:39: Court: Any redirect?\nLine 4, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: No further questions, Your Honor.\nLine 5, 19:01:39: Court: Thank you, sir, you may step down. Proceed with your next witness.\nLine 6, 19:01:39: (Witness excused \u2013 11:56:56 a.m.)\nLine 7, 19:01:39: Summary\nLine 8, 19:01:39: The excerpt showcases the husband of the accident victim testifying about the impact of the accident on\nLine 9, 19:01:39: their family life. Here's a concise summary:\nLine 10, 19:01:39: Before the accident:\nLine 11, 19:01:39: The family was described as happy and engaged in activities, including vacations and family reunions.\nLine 12, 19:01:39: The wife was spontaneous, sociable, and involved in various activities like choir, bible study, and caring\nLine 13, 19:01:39: for their four children.\nLine 14, 19:01:39: She enjoyed her work as an assistant manager at a hair salon.\nLine 15, 19:01:39: After the accident:\nLine 16, 19:01:39: The family life and activity level significantly changed.\nLine 17, 19:01:39: The wife's physical limitations restrict her participation in activities like taking children to events, playing\nLine 18, 19:01:39: sports, or going on family vacations.\nLine 19, 19:01:39: Her reduced activity has even affected how their children perceive her, calling her \"boring.\"\nLine 20, 19:01:39: She struggles with simple tasks like carrying laundry or cooking.\nLine 21, 19:01:39: Impact on the family:\nLine 22, 19:01:39: The wife attempted but couldn't return to work due to pain and difficulty managing long hours.\nLine 23, 19:01:39: The financial burden increased significantly with a single income supporting the family and medical bills.\nLine 24, 19:01:39: The strain on the wife due to pain and frustration has impacted their relationship.\nLine 25, 19:01:39: The children have had to adjust and take on more responsibilities, missing their previous active mother.\nLine 26, 19:01:39: Husband's hope for the future:\nLine 27, 19:01:39: He desires for his wife to find pain relief and regain normalcy in her life.\nLine 28, 19:01:39: Defense cross-examination:\nLine 29, 19:01:39: The husband assists with the wife's foot exercises based on instructions from a chart.\nLine 30, 19:01:39: She still drives and is pursuing a degree online while caring for their children.\n--- End of Page 16 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 17 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: She expects to graduate within the next year.\n--- End of Page 17 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 1 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:53: Deposition:\nLine 2, 19:20:53: Court Reporter: Please state your name for the record.\nLine 3, 19:20:53: Witness: Sarah Miller.\nLine 4, 19:20:53: Court Reporter: And how do you spell your last name, Ms. Miller?\nLine 5, 19:20:53: Witness: M-I-L-L-E-R.\nLine 6, 19:20:53: Mr. Brown: Ms. Miller, are you aware that today's proceedings are a legal deposition and that you are\nLine 7, 19:20:53: under oath to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?\nLine 8, 19:20:53: Witness: Yes, I am aware.\nLine 9, 19:20:53: Mr. Brown: Thank you. Ms. Miller, were you present at the intersection of Main Street and Maple\nLine 10, 19:20:53: Avenue on July 15th, 2023, at approximately 3:00 pm?\nLine 11, 19:20:53: Witness: Yes, I was. I was waiting at the red light on Maple Avenue, southbound, facing east.\nLine 12, 19:20:53: Mr. Brown: Did you witness any accidents at that intersection at that time?\nLine 13, 19:20:53: Witness: Yes, I did. I saw a car traveling westbound on Main Street, which I believe was a blue sedan, run\nLine 14, 19:20:53: the red light and collide with a car traveling northbound on Maple Avenue, which I believe was a white\nLine 15, 19:20:53: SUV.\nLine 16, 19:20:53: Mr. Brown: Can you describe the collision in more detail?\nLine 17, 19:20:53: Witness: The blue sedan seemed to be traveling at a high speed and didn't slow down or attempt to stop\nLine 18, 19:20:53: at the red light. It hit the white SUV directly on the driver's side. The impact was quite forceful, and both\nLine 19, 19:20:53: cars spun around significantly.\nLine 20, 19:20:53: Mr. Lee: Ms. Miller, you mentioned the blue sedan was traveling at a high speed. How fast would you\nLine 21, 19:20:53: say it was going?\nLine 22, 19:20:53: Witness: It's difficult to say for sure, but it appeared to be going much faster than the posted speed\nLine 23, 19:20:53: limit, which is 35 miles per hour.\nLine 24, 19:20:53: Mr. Lee: Did you see the driver of either vehicle at any point?\nLine 25, 19:20:53: Witness: No, I didn't.\nLine 26, 19:20:53: Mr. Brown: Ms. Miller, did you notice anything unusual about the driver's behavior in the blue sedan\nLine 27, 19:20:53: before the accident?\nLine 28, 19:20:53: Witness: It's hard to say. Everything happened very quickly, but the car did seem to be swerving slightly\nLine 29, 19:20:53: just before the collision.\nLine 30, 19:20:53: Mr. Lee: Ms. Miller, did you call the police or offer assistance to anyone involved in the accident?\nLine 31, 19:20:53: Witness: Yes, I immediately called 911 and stayed at the scene until the police arrived.\nLine 32, 19:20:53: Mr. Brown: Did you speak to anyone else who may have witnessed the accident?\n--- End of Page 1 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 2 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:53: Witness: Yes, I exchanged information with another driver who was stopped next to me on Maple\nLine 2, 19:20:53: Avenue at the time.\nLine 3, 19:20:53: Mr. Lee: Do you recall the make and model of the other vehicle that you spoke to?\nLine 4, 19:20:53: Witness: I believe it was a silver Toyota Camry, but I'm not entirely sure.\nLine 5, 19:20:53: Mr. Brown: That's all my questions at this time.\nLine 6, 19:20:53: Mr. Lee: I have no further questions\nLine 7, 19:20:53: Summary:\nLine 8, 19:20:53: The excerpt is from a legal deposition of Michael Anderson, who is under oath to tell the truth. Mr.\nLine 9, 19:20:53: Anderson confirms his employment at Acme Corporation as a graphic designer and details his job duties.\nLine 10, 19:20:53: He also confirms receiving positive performance reviews and never facing disciplinary actions. The\nLine 11, 19:20:53: excerpt ends with a question about witnessing or experiencing any discriminatory situations at Acme.\n--- End of Page 2 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 3 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:53: Deposition:\nLine 2, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Objection, that question calls for legal conclusions from the witness.\nLine 3, 19:20:53: Mr. Thompson: Withdrawn. Mr. Anderson, please describe any specific incidents or instances at Acme\nLine 4, 19:20:53: that involved your [protected category].\nLine 5, 19:20:53: Witness: There were several things that made me feel uncomfortable. During meetings, colleagues often\nLine 6, 19:20:53: talked over me or dismissed my ideas, particularly when compared to my younger male colleagues. I\nLine 7, 19:20:53: was also consistently passed over for promotions despite having experience and qualifications\nLine 8, 19:20:53: comparable to others who got promoted.\nLine 9, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you be specific about which colleagues treated you this way and provide\nLine 10, 19:20:53: specific examples of situations where these incidents occurred?\nLine 11, 19:20:53: Witness: One specific example would be the marketing campaign for the new product launch in 2023. I\nLine 12, 19:20:53: put significant effort into developing design concepts, but they were ultimately disregarded without any\nLine 13, 19:20:53: explanation. My male colleague's design, which was very similar to mine, was ultimately chosen.\nLine 14, 19:20:53: Mr. Thompson: Did you ever report any of these incidents to your supervisor or anyone else at Acme?\nLine 15, 19:20:53: Witness: I once mentioned feeling undervalued to my supervisor, but they brushed it off, suggesting I\nLine 16, 19:20:53: needed to \"work harder to prove myself.\" I wasn't comfortable bringing it up further after that.\nLine 17, 19:20:53: Mr. Thompson: Did you decide to leave Acme voluntarily, or were you terminated?\nLine 18, 19:20:53: Witness: When they announced another promotion I felt qualified for, but was once again passed over\nLine 19, 19:20:53: without explanation, I decided it was time to find a new position where I felt valued and respected.\nLine 20, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you confirm that your decision to leave Acme was solely based on not\nLine 21, 19:20:53: receiving the promotion, and not due to other factors like job performance or personal reasons?\nLine 22, 19:20:53: Witness: To the best of my knowledge, yes. It became clear to me that further advancement\nLine 23, 19:20:53: opportunities within the company were unlikely.\nLine 24, 19:20:53: Mr. Thompson: That's all my questions at this time.\nLine 25, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, during your time at Acme, did you ever receive any negative performance\nLine 26, 19:20:53: reviews or warnings related to your work performance?\nLine 27, 19:20:53: Witness: No, as mentioned before, my performance reviews were always positive.\nLine 28, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Did you ever attend any diversity and inclusion training offered by Acme during your\nLine 29, 19:20:53: employment?\nLine 30, 19:20:53: Witness: I did participate in the mandatory online training modules, but there weren't any specific\nLine 31, 19:20:53: training sessions related to addressing or reporting potentially discriminatory situations within the\nLine 32, 19:20:53: company.\nLine 33, 19:20:53: Summary\n--- End of Page 3 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 4 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:53: Michael Anderson details specific incidents supporting his feeling of being undervalued based on his\nLine 2, 19:20:53: protected category. He describes colleagues disregarding his ideas and being passed over for\nLine 3, 19:20:53: promotions despite comparable qualifications. He provides a specific example from the 2023 product\nLine 4, 19:20:53: launch where his design was overlooked in favor of a male colleague's similar work. He mentions\nLine 5, 19:20:53: mentioning his concerns to his supervisor but being discouraged from pursuing them. He clarifies his\nLine 6, 19:20:53: decision to leave Acme was due to the lack of advancement opportunities, not performance or personal\nLine 7, 19:20:53: reasons. Ms. Garcia then establishes that Mr. Anderson's performance was consistently good and that\nLine 8, 19:20:53: he participated in available diversity training while at Acme, though specific training for addressing\nLine 9, 19:20:53: potential discrimination was absent.\nLine 10, 19:20:53: Deposition:\nLine 11, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, are you aware of Acme's anti-discrimination policy or how complaints of\nLine 12, 19:20:53: discrimination are addressed within the company?\nLine 13, 19:20:53: Witness: I reviewed the employee handbook, which did explain the existence of an anti-discrimination\nLine 14, 19:20:53: policy. However, I was unsure of the specific complaint process at the time\nLine 15, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you elaborate on why you felt apprehensive about bringing up these\nLine 16, 19:20:53: incidents to your supervisor despite feeling uncomfortable and undervalued?\nLine 17, 19:20:53: Witness: Honestly, there were a few reasons. Firstly, as I mentioned, when I did hint at feeling\nLine 18, 19:20:53: undervalued to my supervisor, their dismissive response discouraged me from further discussions. It\nLine 19, 19:20:53: seemed like they weren't receptive to hearing about any potential issues.\nLine 20, 19:20:53: Secondly, there was a general company culture that made me hesitant to speak up. Younger male\nLine 21, 19:20:53: colleagues often dominated conversations and presentations, and there weren't many women in senior\nLine 22, 19:20:53: positions within the marketing department. It felt like my voice wouldn't be heard or even worse, that\nLine 23, 19:20:53: bringing forward complaints might lead to retaliation or hinder my career further.\nLine 24, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Did you notice any specific instances of retaliation against other employees who may have\nLine 25, 19:20:53: raised complaints or concerns about work environment issues?\nLine 26, 19:20:53: Witness: While I can't say for sure, there was one colleague, Sarah Lopez, who openly challenged gender\nLine 27, 19:20:53: bias during a department meeting but was subsequently given less desirable project assignments\nLine 28, 19:20:53: compared to her male colleagues. This incident definitely reinforced my concerns about potentially\nLine 29, 19:20:53: facing a similar situation.**\nLine 30, 19:20:53: Mr. Thompson: Objection, speculation about an unrelated case is irrelevant to the present matter.\nLine 31, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Withdrawn. Mr. Anderson, did you ever discuss your concerns about potential bias or lack of\nLine 32, 19:20:53: promotion opportunities with any human resources personnel at Acme?\nLine 33, 19:20:53: Witness: No, I didn't. As I mentioned before, the lack of clarity on the specific complaint process\nLine 34, 19:20:53: combined with the overall culture discouraged me from pursuing that route.\nLine 35, 19:20:53: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, since leaving Acme, have you sought employment elsewhere?\n--- End of Page 4 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 5 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:54: Witness: Yes, I am currently employed at a different company and feel much more valued and respected\nLine 2, 19:20:54: in my current role. The work environment is significantly more inclusive, and I regularly receive positive\nLine 3, 19:20:54: feedback and opportunities for professional development.\nLine 4, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, how has your experience at Acme impacted you personally and\nLine 5, 19:20:54: professionally?\nLine 6, 19:20:54: Witness: It was definitely a frustrating and discouraging experience. It felt like my hard work and\nLine 7, 19:20:54: qualifications weren't being recognized fairly, leading to some self-doubt and a sense of being\nLine 8, 19:20:54: undervalued. However, finding a new and positive work environment has helped me rebuild my\nLine 9, 19:20:54: confidence and refocus on my career goals.\nLine 10, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: I have no further questions.\nLine 11, 19:20:54: Summary\nLine 12, 19:20:54: This segment explores Mr. Anderson's reasons for not formally complaining despite feeling undervalued.\nLine 13, 19:20:54: He reiterates his supervisor's dismissive response and the perceived lack of receptiveness within the\nLine 14, 19:20:54: company culture. He describes a specific instance where a colleague who challenged gender bias faced\nLine 15, 19:20:54: negative consequences, reinforcing his fear of retaliation. He clarifies that he didn't pursue HR due to\nLine 16, 19:20:54: unclear procedures and the discouraging company culture. Finally, he highlights his positive experience\nLine 17, 19:20:54: at a new company, emphasizing feelings of value, inclusion, and professional growth in contrast to his\nLine 18, 19:20:54: experience at Acme. He concludes by acknowledging the frustration and self-doubt from Acme but also\nLine 19, 19:20:54: the positive impact of finding a supportive work environment.\nLine 20, 19:20:54: Deposition\nLine 21, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: I have one final question. Mr. Anderson, is there anything else you would like to add\nLine 22, 19:20:54: regarding your experience at Acme Corporation?\nLine 23, 19:20:54: Witness: Just that I hope by sharing my story, it can contribute to fostering a more diverse and inclusive\nLine 24, 19:20:54: work environment at Acme for future employees. Everyone deserves to feel valued and respected in\nLine 25, 19:20:54: their workplace, regardless of their [protected category].\nLine 26, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Interesting point, Mr. Anderson. Ms. Garcia, while you have no further questions, I'd like\nLine 27, 19:20:54: to explore some aspects of Mr. Anderson's experience further before concluding the deposition.\nLine 28, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: No objection. Please proceed, Mr. Thompson.\nLine 29, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, you mentioned feeling unsure about the specific complaint process at\nLine 30, 19:20:54: Acme. Did you take any steps to learn more about it after your meeting with your supervisor?\nLine 31, 19:20:54: Witness: No, I didn't feel comfortable approaching my supervisor again after their dismissive response.\nLine 32, 19:20:54: Additionally, I recall the employee handbook being quite lengthy, and finding specific information about\nLine 33, 19:20:54: the complaint process proved difficult at the time.\n--- End of Page 5 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 6 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: You mentioned a colleague, Sarah Lopez, who voiced concerns about gender bias. Did\nLine 2, 19:20:54: you ever speak to her directly about her experience and the alleged retaliation she faced?\nLine 3, 19:20:54: Witness: Briefly, yes. We expressed our mutual frustrations and the feeling of being undervalued within\nLine 4, 19:20:54: the department. However, we were both hesitant to pursue any formal complaints due to the\nLine 5, 19:20:54: aforementioned concerns about the company culture and potential retaliation.\nLine 6, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Did you ever discuss the issue of lack of promotion opportunities with any other\nLine 7, 19:20:54: colleagues, particularly women in the marketing department?\nLine 8, 19:20:54: Witness: Not directly. While there were a few women colleagues in the department, none of them were\nLine 9, 19:20:54: in senior positions. The general environment discouraged open communication about potentially\nLine 10, 19:20:54: sensitive topics like discrimination.\nLine 11, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Thompson, I object to leading the witness. Can you rephrase your question and allow\nLine 12, 19:20:54: Mr. Anderson to answer in his own words?\nLine 13, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Apologies, Ms. Garcia. Mr. Anderson, to clarify, did you have any informal conversations\nLine 14, 19:20:54: with other colleagues about your concerns regarding promotion opportunities or potential gender bias\nLine 15, 19:20:54: within the marketing department at Acme?\nLine 16, 19:20:54: Witness: There weren't any specific discussions about promotions or bias, but the general atmosphere\nLine 17, 19:20:54: around the lack of female representation in senior positions was a frequent topic of quiet observation\nLine 18, 19:20:54: amongst some female colleagues. We felt implicit pressure to work harder and prove ourselves more\nLine 19, 19:20:54: than our male colleagues, but reaching leadership positions seemed like an increasingly distant\nLine 20, 19:20:54: prospect.\nLine 21, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you elaborate on what kind of \"pressure\" you felt, and was there any\nLine 22, 19:20:54: specific instance or behavior from colleagues or superiors that made you feel this way?\nLine 23, 19:20:54: Summary\nLine 24, 19:20:54: In the concluding segment, Mr. Anderson expresses hope that his experience can contribute to a more\nLine 25, 19:20:54: inclusive work environment at Acme. Mr. Thompson then delves deeper into specific aspects of Mr.\nLine 26, 19:20:54: Anderson's experience:\nLine 27, 19:20:54: Complaint process: Mr. Anderson cites discomfort following his supervisor's reaction and difficulty\nLine 28, 19:20:54: navigating the lengthy employee handbook as reasons for not seeking further information.\nLine 29, 19:20:54: Colleague's experience: He mentions briefly discussing his frustrations and concerns with Sarah Lopez\nLine 30, 19:20:54: but clarifies their shared hesitation to pursue formal complaints due to company culture concerns.\nLine 31, 19:20:54: Promotion opportunities and gender bias: He explains the lack of open communication about these\nLine 32, 19:20:54: issues and feeling unspoken pressure due to the absence of women in senior positions, though no\nLine 33, 19:20:54: specific discussions on bias occurred.\nLine 34, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia objects to a leading question about bias, and Mr. Thompson rephrases, allowing Mr.\nLine 35, 19:20:54: Anderson to clarify further. He explains the silent observation among female colleagues of the lack of\n--- End of Page 6 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 7 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:54: female leadership and the perceived need to overachieve compared to male colleagues. Ms. Garcia\nLine 2, 19:20:54: requests further details about the pressure felt by Mr. Anderson.\nLine 3, 19:20:54: Deposition\nLine 4, 19:20:54: Witness: It wasn't any direct confrontation or statement, but more of a subtle feeling arising from\nLine 5, 19:20:54: observing the lack of female representation in leadership roles combined with certain comments about\nLine 6, 19:20:54: needing to \"work harder\" or \"prove myself\" despite my consistent positive performance reviews.\nLine 7, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Thank you, Mr. Anderson. These are valuable insights. Do you have any further\nLine 8, 19:20:54: questions, Ms. Garcia?\nLine 9, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: (after reviewing her notes) I have a few follow-up questions for clarification. However, due\nLine 10, 19:20:54: to the time constraints, I would like to schedule a follow-up session at your earliest convenience, Mr.\nLine 11, 19:20:54: Thompson, to continue exploring specific details and potential evidence.\nLine 12, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: No objection. Mr. Anderson, are you available for a follow-up session within the next\nLine 13, 19:20:54: week?\nLine 14, 19:20:54: Witness: Yes, I am available. Please let me know the details when you've scheduled it\nLine 15, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, since our last session, have you had any time to review Acme\nLine 16, 19:20:54: Corporation's employee handbook pertaining to the complaint process for potential discrimination?\nLine 17, 19:20:54: Witness: Yes, I have.\nLine 18, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Can you briefly describe the steps outlined in the handbook for filing a complaint based\nLine 19, 19:20:54: on potential discrimination?\nLine 20, 19:20:54: Witness: The handbook mentioned employees could submit a written complaint to the Human\nLine 21, 19:20:54: Resources department or verbally report it to an HR representative or any manager. However, specific\nLine 22, 19:20:54: details about the investigation process or resolution options were quite vague.\nLine 23, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, did the employee handbook specify who constitutes a \"manager\" authorized\nLine 24, 19:20:54: to receive such initial verbal complaints?\nLine 25, 19:20:54: Witness: No, it didn't provide any specific details about which managers were included in that definition\nLine 26, 19:20:54: or if all managers were authorized to receive such reports.\nLine 27, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, you previously mentioned frustration with receiving similar design\nLine 28, 19:20:54: concepts to yours being chosen over your own work while working at Acme. Do you still have copies of\nLine 29, 19:20:54: these original design concepts and the final versions ultimately used?\nLine 30, 19:20:54: Witness: Unfortunately, I didn't retain individual copies of every design iteration. However, I did\nLine 31, 19:20:54: maintain some preliminary sketches and digital drafts from several projects, including the one discussed\nLine 32, 19:20:54: earlier related to the 2023 product launch campaign.\nLine 33, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Would you be willing to provide these materials as potential evidence in this case?\nLine 34, 19:20:54: Witness: Yes, I can bring them to the next session.\n--- End of Page 7 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 8 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, are you aware of other colleagues who may have retained copies of their\nLine 2, 19:20:54: rejected design projects or drafts during their employment at Acme?\nLine 3, 19:20:54: Witness: I'm not certain, but I remember several colleagues raising concerns about the inconsistent\nLine 4, 19:20:54: feedback and selection process for design concepts. It's possible some of them might have kept records\nLine 5, 19:20:54: for their own reference.\nLine 6, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: We will look into that possibility. Mr. Anderson, during your time at Acme, did you ever\nLine 7, 19:20:54: meet or hear about any employees who filed official complaints based on experiencing discrimination?\nLine 8, 19:20:54: Witness: Not officially. As mentioned earlier, there was an underlying lack of transparency and open\nLine 9, 19:20:54: communication around potentially sensitive topics like discrimination. Therefore, it was difficult to know\nLine 10, 19:20:54: for sure.\nLine 11, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, did you receive any additional training or workshops related to diversity and\nLine 12, 19:20:54: inclusion since leaving Acme Corporation?\nLine 13, 19:20:54: Witness: Yes, my current employer offers comprehensive training programs and workshops regarding\nLine 14, 19:20:54: diversity and inclusion as part of their ongoing commitment to a fair and equitable work environment.\nLine 15, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Do you find these additional training programs and the overall work environment at\nLine 16, 19:20:54: your current company to be beneficial compared to your experience at Acme?\nLine 17, 19:20:54: Witness: Absolutely. The focus on creating a safe space for open communication, valuing diverse\nLine 18, 19:20:54: perspectives, and providing equal opportunities for growth has been incredibly positive and\nLine 19, 19:20:54: empowering.\nLine 20, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: No further questions at this time.\nLine 21, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, as mentioned previously, we would like you to bring copies of the design\nLine 22, 19:20:54: materials you retained for the next session. Additionally, I may reach out to inquire about potential\nLine 23, 19:20:54: colleagues who might have kept similar records. Is that alright?\nLine 24, 19:20:54: Witness: That's perfectly fine. Please let me know if you need anything else in the meantime.\nLine 25, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, one final question before we adjourn. You mentioned feeling hesitant to\nLine 26, 19:20:54: bring up your concerns to your supervisor after their dismissive response. Did their reaction specifically\nLine 27, 19:20:54: mention any consequences of raising the potential bias issue?\nLine 28, 19:20:54: Witness: Not directly. There wasn't an explicit threat of any sort. However, their dismissive tone and the\nLine 29, 19:20:54: implication that my concerns weren't valid created an atmosphere where I felt further discussion would\nLine 30, 19:20:54: be futile and potentially disadvantageous.\nLine 31, 19:20:54: Ms. Garcia: Objection, speculation about the witness's interpretation of a supervisor's tone is not based\nLine 32, 19:20:54: on facts.\nLine 33, 19:20:54: Mr. Thompson: Reframing, Mr. Anderson. How did your supervisor's response make you feel about the\nLine 34, 19:20:54: potential consequences of reporting your concerns?\n--- End of Page 8 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 9 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:55: Witness: Their response discouraged me and made me feel unheard. It conveyed the impression that my\nLine 2, 19:20:55: concerns about potential bias wouldn't be taken seriously and could potentially hinder my career\nLine 3, 19:20:55: progression within the company.\nLine 4, 19:20:55: Summary\nLine 5, 19:20:55: The concluding segment addresses further details and sets the stage for a follow-up session:\nLine 6, 19:20:55: Complaint process: Mr. Anderson reviews the handbook and describes the outlined steps for filing a\nLine 7, 19:20:55: complaint, noting the vagueness regarding investigation and resolution. Ms. Garcia highlights the lack of\nLine 8, 19:20:55: clarity on who qualifies as a \"manager\" authorized to receive initial verbal reports.\nLine 9, 19:20:55: Design concepts: Mr. Anderson clarifies he still possesses some preliminary sketches and drafts,\nLine 10, 19:20:55: including those from the 2023 product launch, and agrees to provide them as potential evidence. Mr.\nLine 11, 19:20:55: Thompson expresses interest in exploring the possibility of other colleagues retaining similar materials.\nLine 12, 19:20:55: Official complaints: Mr. Anderson reiterates the lack of knowledge about any official discrimination\nLine 13, 19:20:55: complaints at Acme due to the previously mentioned culture of secrecy.\nLine 14, 19:20:55: Current company: Mr. Anderson confirms receiving additional diversity and inclusion training at his\nLine 15, 19:20:55: current company. He emphasizes the positive aspects of his new work environment, highlighting open\nLine 16, 19:20:55: communication, valuing diverse perspectives, and equal opportunities, contrasting it with his experience\nLine 17, 19:20:55: at Acme.\nLine 18, 19:20:55: Follow-up: Both parties agree to a follow-up session. Mr. Thompson clarifies his intention to request the\nLine 19, 19:20:55: design materials and potentially contact other colleagues. Ms. Garcia objects to the witness's\nLine 20, 19:20:55: interpretation of his supervisor's tone, leading Mr. Thompson to rephrase the question, to which Mr.\nLine 21, 19:20:55: Anderson reiterates feeling discouraged and unheard, fearing his concerns wouldn't be taken seriously\nLine 22, 19:20:55: and could hinder his career.\nLine 23, 19:20:55: Deposition\nLine 24, 19:20:55: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Thompson, I believe we've covered the essential topics for today. However, as these are\nLine 25, 19:20:55: complex claims, I would appreciate the opportunity to review the transcript and potentially ask further\nLine 26, 19:20:55: questions at a future session, should any need arise.\nLine 27, 19:20:55: Mr. Thompson: No objection. Mr. Anderson, as Ms. Garcia mentioned, we appreciate your willingness to\nLine 28, 19:20:55: cooperate and provide additional materials. We will be in touch to schedule a follow-up session if\nLine 29, 19:20:55: needed.\nLine 30, 19:20:55: Witness: Understood.\nLine 31, 19:20:55: Summary\nLine 32, 19:20:55: The deposition concludes with Ms. Garcia expressing a desire to review the transcript and potentially\nLine 33, 19:20:55: ask further questions in a future session if needed. Mr. Thompson agrees, and both thank Mr. Anderson\nLine 34, 19:20:55: for his cooperation and willingness to provide additional materials. Mr. Anderson acknowledges their\nLine 35, 19:20:55: communication and awaits further information regarding a potential follow-up session.\n--- End of Page 9 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 10 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:55: Deposition\nLine 2, 19:20:55: MILLER: A driver is obligated to pay attention to the road and yield to other drivers when required. Let\nLine 3, 19:20:55: me take you back to what happened on April 20th, 2022. The Defendant, who was an attorney for the\nLine 4, 19:20:55: IRS, was driving her usual route to work. She drove down Annapolis Road to take a left onto another\nLine 5, 19:20:55: road.\nLine 6, 19:20:55: (Could we have the next slide, please?) She was driving down this road\u2026 can everyone see this? She\nLine 7, 19:20:55: stopped at a light on a clear day. While stopped, she reached down to find her parking pass.\nLine 8, 19:20:55: DEFENSE LAWYER: May we approach?\nLine 9, 19:20:55: THE COURT: Yes.\nLine 10, 19:20:55: BENCH CONFERENCE\nLine 11, 19:20:55: (Bench Conference begins \u2013 10:26:39m.)\nLine 12, 19:20:55: (The parties approach the bench for a discussion.)\nLine 13, 19:20:55: THE COURT: By court ruling, liability has been established. The focus of this case is only on damages. I\nLine 14, 19:20:55: understand why we\u2019re discussing these details, but it\u2019s about damages.\nLine 15, 19:20:55: MILLER: I\u2019m setting the scene for the accident because her damages are part of the accident narrative.\nLine 16, 19:20:55: DEFENSE LAWYER: We\u2019re only discussing the fact that an accident happened and a person was injured.\nLine 17, 19:20:55: The details about reaching and negligence seem to be evidence of liability.\nLine 18, 19:20:55: THE COURT: I understand. It\u2019s your opening statement, so I\u2019ll give you some leeway.\nLine 19, 19:20:55: MILLER: I\u2019m just providing context. I\u2019ll be getting into the damages soon.\nLine 20, 19:20:55: THE COURT: Alright.\nLine 21, 19:20:55: (Bench Conference concluded \u2013 10:27:32 m.)\nLine 22, 19:20:55: (The parties return to their places.)\nLine 23, 19:20:55: MILLER: The Defendant heard a horn beep and took a left turn. She didn\u2019t see the Plaintiff, who had the\nLine 24, 19:20:55: right of way, coming from the opposite direction. Due to the collision, the Plaintiff\u2019s ankle was broken\nLine 25, 19:20:55: and required surgery.\nLine 26, 19:20:55: Take a look at these images. The first one shows her ankle before surgery, the second one after surgery.\nLine 27, 19:20:55: Today, she still has 15 screws and three plates in her ankle. She will never be able to run again and\nLine 28, 19:20:55: standing for extended periods of time is difficult.\nLine 29, 19:20:55: We\u2019ve brought this case before you because of the harm caused to the Plaintiff. We needed to agree\nLine 30, 19:20:55: that the Defendant was at fault for the accident, which she has accepted. We also had to understand the\nLine 31, 19:20:55: extent and implications of the Plaintiff\u2019s damages, not just the initial injury and surgery, but also its long-\nLine 32, 19:20:55: term impact on her life.\nLine 33, 19:20:55: To do this, we spoke to her doctors, her husband, her friends, and even her employer. One of her\nLine 34, 19:20:55: doctors is going to talk to you.\n--- End of Page 10 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 11 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:55: This is the guy to see if something awful like this is going to happen to your ankle. He received an Ivy\nLine 2, 19:20:55: League education and, at one point, was the chief of foot and ankle orthopedic injuries at Johns\nLine 3, 19:20:55: Hopkins. He consults for the Baltimore Orioles. His resume, I want to say, is as long as your arm, but it\u2019s\nLine 4, 19:20:55: actually a lot longer than that.\nLine 5, 19:20:55: We\u2019re going to bring him to talk to you guys, in a very 2023 way. It\u2019s going to be by videotape, so his\nLine 6, 19:20:55: testimony will be by videotape, but it holds the same force as if it was at trial, and he came here to see\nLine 7, 19:20:55: us. And, of course, my partner Laura Zois and the defense attorney had an opportunity to ask him\nLine 8, 19:20:55: questions.\nLine 9, 19:20:55: He\u2019s going to tell you she still has 15 screws and three plates in her ankle holding everything together.\nLine 10, 19:20:55: The problem with that is that it creates a breeding ground for arthritis, and this 33-year-old woman\nLine 11, 19:20:55: already has the signs of arthritis. At some point, she\u2019s going to need what\u2019s called a fusion, which will\nLine 12, 19:20:55: stabilize her ankle. The bad news is, you can\u2019t move it once it locks, so you no longer have the ability to\nLine 13, 19:20:55: bend.\nLine 14, 19:20:55: This trial is about the harms and losses that she has suffered and endured as the result of this accident.\nLine 15, 19:20:55: This is not a case about sympathy. You should not award her damages because you feel sorry for her.\nLine 16, 19:20:55: You\u2019re going to hear about how the accident has impacted her professional and personal life.\nLine 17, 19:20:55: At the time of the crash, they were a very young family. They were an energetic family. This is an active\nLine 18, 19:20:55: family with four kids doing everything you can imagine, Six Flags, the park. They would run together.\nLine 19, 19:20:55: They played basketball together. They traveled everywhere, New York, Baltimore, Washington, DC. They\nLine 20, 19:20:55: were just a very active family.\nLine 21, 19:20:55: And she also had a vibrant social life. She was a hairstylist, and she loved that job. It was her social outlet\nLine 22, 19:20:55: beside her kids. She would do the church choir every Wednesday, and still found times to go out and see\nLine 23, 19:20:55: her family. She\u2019s still fighting with her family, but it\u2019s hard.\nLine 24, 19:20:55: She can\u2019t work as a hairstylist anymore. So what did she do? She went back to school to the University\nLine 25, 19:20:55: of Maryland. She\u2019s working, getting very close to getting her degree. She\u2019s still fighting. She has four kids\nLine 26, 19:20:55: they\u2019re chasing around.\nLine 27, 19:20:55: Let\u2019s go back and talk about how it ended up. Let\u2019s talk about the accident. She had this awful crash and\nLine 28, 19:20:55: needed emergency surgery where they put in these screws. She had a nine-month-old baby, along with\nLine 29, 19:20:55: three other kids. She and the two girls, the younger ones, went to live with her mom. Her mom took\nLine 30, 19:20:55: care of her and the girls, while her husband took care of the other kids.\nLine 31, 19:20:55: This has been a massive disruption to their lives. The accident has completely changed her life, and it\u2019s\nLine 32, 19:20:55: reflected in every facet of her day-to-day. Her job, her family life, her hobbies, everything she used to\nLine 33, 19:20:55: take pleasure in has been impacted in one way or another. And the evidence in this case will show these\nLine 34, 19:20:55: changes are likely to persist for the rest of her life.\nLine 35, 19:20:55: We ask you to consider the totality of these changes, the persistent harm and loss she\u2019s suffered and\nLine 36, 19:20:55: will continue to suffer, as a direct result of the accident. We ask you to consider these when coming to a\nLine 37, 19:20:55: decision in this case.\n--- End of Page 11 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 12 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:55: This accident, however, led to an upheaval in their lives. About a month after the accident, she managed\nLine 2, 19:20:55: to return home with the kids. Her mother, an FDA employee, took three months off work to care for her,\nLine 3, 19:20:55: her daughter, and her grandchildren. The accident wreaked havoc on their lives.\nLine 4, 19:20:55: She endured six months of rigorous physical therapy and another operation. While it was painful and\nLine 5, 19:20:55: difficult, the effort was worthwhile as it improved her condition, especially her ankle, though we wish\nLine 6, 19:20:55: she had recovered more.\nLine 7, 19:20:55: As we delve into this case, it\u2019s about the harm and losses experienced. We will ask you to make amends\nLine 8, 19:20:55: where possible and provide compensation for the irreparable harm. The damages can be categorized\nLine 9, 19:20:55: into three parts: her medical bills, the post-accident trauma suffered by her and her family, and the pain\nLine 10, 19:20:55: she will endure for the expected next 45 years of her life.\nLine 11, 19:20:55: She was a spontaneous person, fond of making impromptu plans like going to Virginia Beach over the\nLine 12, 19:20:55: weekend or heading to the park. Now, every activity revolves around her ability to reach there, her\nLine 13, 19:20:55: mobility, and whether she can tolerate the pain during the trip. This situation has affected her and her\nLine 14, 19:20:55: four kids, as well as her husband.\nLine 15, 19:20:55: The court wants to clarify that the evidence and testimonies from the witness stand are what will\nLine 16, 19:20:55: control your deliberations. Opening statements and closing arguments of lawyers do not constitute\nLine 17, 19:20:55: evidence.\nLine 18, 19:20:55: This case is not just about the suffering of their children or her husband. It\u2019s about the impact of their\nLine 19, 19:20:55: suffering on her. We will ask you to consider an amount that may seem high at the beginning. But we\nLine 20, 19:20:55: believe that after hearing all the evidence, you\u2019ll find it to be a fair compensation for her losses and\nLine 21, 19:20:55: harm. The amount we suggest is $1.1 million.\nLine 22, 19:20:55: Defense Opening Statement\nLine 23, 19:20:55: Regarding the defendant, they acknowledge the responsibility for the accident and that it was their\nLine 24, 19:20:55: fault. The case is for you to determine the appropriate damages. The injury is severe, and they ask for an\nLine 25, 19:20:55: extraordinary amount of compensation.\nLine 26, 19:20:55: She broke her ankle, which was repaired surgically with plates and screws. There was a second surgery\nLine 27, 19:20:55: due to loosening of the screws, which were then removed. She attended physical therapy, which\nLine 28, 19:20:55: improved her ability to move her ankle. Whether she will need surgery in the future is uncertain.\nLine 29, 19:20:55: The past medical expenses are around $36,505, which we don\u2019t contest. Her lost wages due to the\nLine 30, 19:20:55: accident are around $3,400 to $3,500. These are not the focal points of this case. The main issue is the\nLine 31, 19:20:55: amount to be awarded for non-economic damages, for which we request something fair, reasonable,\nLine 32, 19:20:55: and sensible.\nLine 33, 19:20:55: Thank you for your time and attention, and we hope to conclude this case promptly.\nLine 34, 19:20:55: Testimony of Victim\u2019s Husband\nLine 35, 19:20:55: Mr. Miller: Good morning. Can I have your address?\nLine 36, 19:20:55: SJ: Certainly.\nLine 37, 19:20:55: Mr. Miller: How long have you lived at that address?\n--- End of Page 12 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 13 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:56: SJ: I bought the house in 2003, so it\u2019s been approximately ten years.\nLine 2, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Who lives there with you?\nLine 3, 19:20:56: SJ: My wife, and our four children.\nLine 4, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Can you tell the jury how old your children are and their names?\nLine 5, 19:20:56: SJ: Yes. My children are 13, and the others are\u2026\nLine 6, 19:20:56: The Honorable Judge: Please continue.\nLine 7, 19:20:56: SJ: \u2026five, and three.\nLine 8, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: I understand. And for some background, what do you do for a living?\nLine 9, 19:20:56: SJ: I\u2019m currently the general manager at Oreck Clean Home Center.\nLine 10, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: And where are these locations?\nLine 11, 19:20:56: SJ: We have six locations in Maryland and Virginia.\nLine 12, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: What are your responsibilities at work?\nLine 13, 19:20:56: SJ: I oversee all six stores and manage one of them.\nLine 14, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Can you describe your work schedule?\nLine 15, 19:20:56: SJ: I work Monday through Saturday, from 10:00 am to 7:00 pm. Often, I work seven days a week which\nLine 16, 19:20:56: means working on Sundays from 12:00 pm to 5:00 pm.\nLine 17, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: How do you feel about those hours?\nLine 18, 19:20:56: SJ: They are long, but I need to work to support my family.\nLine 19, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: How long have you known your wife?\nLine 20, 19:20:56: SJ: I met her in 1993, she was my sister\u2019s best friend.\nLine 21, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: You mean your wife was your sister\u2019s best friend?\nLine 22, 19:20:56: SJ: Yes, I apologize for the confusion. She was indeed my sister\u2019s best friend.\nLine 23, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Let\u2019s move to another topic. Do you remember the car accident your wife was in 2022?\nLine 24, 19:20:56: SJ: Yes, I do.\nLine 25, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Prior to the accident, can you describe your household?\nLine 26, 19:20:56: SJ: Our household was what I would consider the perfect life. My wife and children were happy and\nLine 27, 19:20:56: always engaged in activities. We used to take vacations and attend family reunions.\nLine 28, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Was your wife a spontaneous person or a planner?\nLine 29, 19:20:56: SJ: She was more spontaneous, always ready to take on new activities.\n--- End of Page 13 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 14 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Could you describe her for the jury?\nLine 2, 19:20:56: SJ: She is always happy, loves socializing and helping people. She attended choir rehearsal, Bible study\nLine 3, 19:20:56: every week, and also took care of our four children.\nLine 4, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: What was her job at the time of the crash?\nLine 5, 19:20:56: SJ: She was the assistant manager of a hair salon.\nLine 6, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Did she enjoy her work?\nLine 7, 19:20:56: SJ: Yes, she loved her work. It was part of her identity.\nLine 8, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Did your wife\u2019s demeanor change after the car accident?\nLine 9, 19:20:56: SJ: Yes, after the accident everything changed. Our family life and activity level changed significantly. She\nLine 10, 19:20:56: used to take the children to sporting events and practice basketball. Now, she can\u2019t do these activities.\nLine 11, 19:20:56: She no longer goes on family vacations. My two older sons call her \u201cboring\u201d now because of her reduced\nLine 12, 19:20:56: activity level. The accident has restricted her capabilities and as a result, she can\u2019t even do simple tasks\nLine 13, 19:20:56: like carrying laundry baskets or standing up to cook. Our family life has changed drastically since the\nLine 14, 19:20:56: accident.\nLine 15, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Has your wife gone back to work since the accident?\nLine 16, 19:20:56: SJ: She tried to help a friend out a couple of months ago at her hair salon, but it ended with her in a lot\nLine 17, 19:20:56: of pain due to the swelling in her ankle.\nLine 18, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: I have here a picture you received from your wife. Is this the picture she sent you?\nLine 19, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Can you tell us how your wife\u2019s personal social life has been affected since the crash?\nLine 20, 19:20:56: SJ: Her social life has indeed changed significantly. Before the accident, she would regularly go out with\nLine 21, 19:20:56: friends, engage in dancing, and other social activities. However, the constant pain and discomfort after\nLine 22, 19:20:56: the crash have made such activities impossible. Her social life is definitely not the same as before.\nLine 23, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: You mentioned earlier about her job. Was she able to resume work post the crash?\nLine 24, 19:20:56: SJ: She attempted to return to work, but the persistent pain made it unmanageable, particularly the\nLine 25, 19:20:56: long-standing hours. Eventually, she was forced to leave her job.\nLine 26, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: How has this situation impacted your family\u2019s finances?\nLine 27, 19:20:56: SJ: The impact has been substantial. She held the position of an assistant manager at a hair salon,\nLine 28, 19:20:56: bringing in a significant income. Now, with my single income, managing expenses for our four children\nLine 29, 19:20:56: and her medical bills has been strenuous.\nLine 30, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Besides the financial struggle, can you share how your relationship with your wife has\nLine 31, 19:20:56: evolved post the accident?\nLine 32, 19:20:56: SJ: Our relationship has undeniably been affected. She isn\u2019t the same person she was before the crash.\nLine 33, 19:20:56: Her constant pain and fatigue, coupled with frustration, have been hard on both of us.\nLine 34, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: And your children? How have they been coping with all these changes?\n--- End of Page 14 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 15 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:56: SJ: Our children have had to make significant adjustments. They miss the mother they had before the\nLine 2, 19:20:56: crash, not understanding why she can\u2019t engage in the activities she used to do with them. My older\nLine 3, 19:20:56: sons, in particular, have had to step up, assisting more with household chores. It\u2019s been a lot for them\nLine 4, 19:20:56: too.\nLine 5, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: Finally, could you share your hopes for your wife\u2019s future?\nLine 6, 19:20:56: SJ: My biggest hope is for her to find relief from her pain and regain some semblance of normalcy. She\nLine 7, 19:20:56: deserves to live her life, not just endure it. It\u2019s challenging to see such a wonderful person go through\nLine 8, 19:20:56: this. We are taking each day as it comes, hoping for a better future.\nLine 9, 19:20:56: Defense Attorney Cross Examination of Victim\u2019s Husband\nLine 10, 19:20:56: Q: Regarding the foot stretching exercises, you assist her with those?\nLine 11, 19:20:56: A: Yes, I do.\nLine 12, 19:20:56: Q: Looking through her medical records, I noticed there\u2019s mention of an exercise bike at home. Do you\nLine 13, 19:20:56: have one?\nLine 14, 19:20:56: A: Indeed, we do have an exercise bike at home.\nLine 15, 19:20:56: Q: Did she frequently use the exercise bike, especially post-accident?\nLine 16, 19:20:56: A: Initially, during her therapy, they had her try riding the exercise bike.\nLine 17, 19:20:56: Q: Can you tell us what kind of exercises she did at home after the accident?\nLine 18, 19:20:56: A: She was given a chart with exercises, and I\u2019ve been helping her to flex her foot in both directions to\nLine 19, 19:20:56: try and loosen it up.\nLine 20, 19:20:56: Q: How long did this routine last?\nLine 21, 19:20:56: A: Actually, I still assist her with the foot exercises every night.\nLine 22, 19:20:56: Q: So you assist her based on the instructions from the chart?\nLine 23, 19:20:56: A: Not directly from the chart, but I\u2019ve learned the correct angles and try to flex her foot every night for\nLine 24, 19:20:56: her comfort and to aid her sleep.\nLine 25, 19:20:56: Q: Does she drive?\nLine 26, 19:20:56: A: Yes, she does.\nLine 27, 19:20:56: Q: Prior to the accident, she was employed full time?\nLine 28, 19:20:56: A: Yes, that\u2019s correct.\nLine 29, 19:20:56: Q: The jury was informed initially that she was also pursuing a degree?\nLine 30, 19:20:56: A: Yes, she was attending the University of Maryland.\nLine 31, 19:20:56: Q: Did she commute to the university?\nLine 32, 19:20:56: A: At certain points she did, but due to our four children, she primarily takes her classes online now.\n--- End of Page 15 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 16 ---\nLine 1, 19:20:56: Q: How close is she to obtaining her degree?\nLine 2, 19:20:56: A: She\u2019s expected to graduate within the next year.\nLine 3, 19:20:56: Court: Any redirect?\nLine 4, 19:20:56: Mr. Miller: No further questions, Your Honor.\nLine 5, 19:20:56: Court: Thank you, sir, you may step down.
