There was some damage done\nLine 592, 16:06:43: to the motor of the car, I think, because I had to\nLine 593, 16:06:43: take it back to Thompson Dodge because it was doing\nLine 594, 16:06:43: so much rattling, and they had to do something to\nLine 595, 16:06:43: the steering.\nLine 596, 16:06:43: Q. Okay. So the two of you were going\nLine 597, 16:06:43: alongside of each other on North Point for a period\nLine 598, 16:06:43: of time at about the same speed, and did you ever\nLine 599, 16:06:43: see a turn signal on the truck?\nLine 600, 16:06:43: A.

There was some damage done\nLine 592, 16:06:43: to the motor of the car, I think, because I had to\nLine 593, 16:06:43: take it back to Thompson Dodge because it was doing\nLine 594, 16:06:43: so much rattling, and they had to do something to\nLine 595, 16:06:43: the steering.\nLine 596, 16:06:43: Q.
