{"deposition": "--- Beginning of Page 1 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:36: Deposition:\nLine 2, 19:01:36: Court Reporter: Please state your name for the record.\nLine 3, 19:01:36: Witness: Sarah Miller.\nLine 4, 19:01:36: Court Reporter: And how do you spell your last name, Ms. Miller?\nLine 5, 19:01:36: Witness: M-I-L-L-E-R.\nLine 6, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: Ms. Miller, are you aware that today's proceedings are a legal deposition and that you are\nLine 7, 19:01:36: under oath to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?\nLine 8, 19:01:36: Witness: Yes, I am aware.\nLine 9, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: Thank you. Ms. Miller, were you present at the intersection of Main Street and Maple\nLine 10, 19:01:36: Avenue on July 15th, 2023, at approximately 3:00 pm?\nLine 11, 19:01:36: Witness: Yes, I was. I was waiting at the red light on Maple Avenue, southbound, facing east.\nLine 12, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: Did you witness any accidents at that intersection at that time?\nLine 13, 19:01:36: Witness: Yes, I did. I saw a car traveling westbound on Main Street, which I believe was a blue sedan, run\nLine 14, 19:01:36: the red light and collide with a car traveling northbound on Maple Avenue, which I believe was a white\nLine 15, 19:01:36: SUV.\nLine 16, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: Can you describe the collision in more detail?\nLine 17, 19:01:36: Witness: The blue sedan seemed to be traveling at a high speed and didn't slow down or attempt to stop\nLine 18, 19:01:36: at the red light. It hit the white SUV directly on the driver's side. The impact was quite forceful, and both\nLine 19, 19:01:36: cars spun around significantly.\nLine 20, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: Ms. Miller, you mentioned the blue sedan was traveling at a high speed. How fast would you\nLine 21, 19:01:36: say it was going?\nLine 22, 19:01:36: Witness: It's difficult to say for sure, but it appeared to be going much faster than the posted speed\nLine 23, 19:01:36: limit, which is 35 miles per hour.\nLine 24, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: Did you see the driver of either vehicle at any point?\nLine 25, 19:01:36: Witness: No, I didn't.\nLine 26, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: Ms. Miller, did you notice anything unusual about the driver's behavior in the blue sedan\nLine 27, 19:01:36: before the accident?\nLine 28, 19:01:36: Witness: It's hard to say. Everything happened very quickly, but the car did seem to be swerving slightly\nLine 29, 19:01:36: just before the collision.\nLine 30, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: Ms. Miller, did you call the police or offer assistance to anyone involved in the accident?\nLine 31, 19:01:36: Witness: Yes, I immediately called 911 and stayed at the scene until the police arrived.\nLine 32, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: Did you speak to anyone else who may have witnessed the accident?\n--- End of Page 1 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 2 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:36: Witness: Yes, I exchanged information with another driver who was stopped next to me on Maple\nLine 2, 19:01:36: Avenue at the time.\nLine 3, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: Do you recall the make and model of the other vehicle that you spoke to?\nLine 4, 19:01:36: Witness: I believe it was a silver Toyota Camry, but I'm not entirely sure.\nLine 5, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: That's all my questions at this time.\nLine 6, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: I have no further questions\nLine 7, 19:01:36: Summary:\nLine 8, 19:01:36: The excerpt is from a legal deposition of Michael Anderson, who is under oath to tell the truth. Mr.\nLine 9, 19:01:36: Anderson confirms his employment at Acme Corporation as a graphic designer and details his job duties.\nLine 10, 19:01:36: He also confirms receiving positive performance reviews and never facing disciplinary actions. The\nLine 11, 19:01:36: excerpt ends with a question about witnessing or experiencing any discriminatory situations at Acme.\n--- End of Page 2 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 3 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:36: Deposition:\nLine 2, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Objection, that question calls for legal conclusions from the witness.\nLine 3, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: Withdrawn. Mr. Anderson, please describe any specific incidents or instances at Acme\nLine 4, 19:01:36: that involved your [protected category].\nLine 5, 19:01:36: Witness: There were several things that made me feel uncomfortable. During meetings, colleagues often\nLine 6, 19:01:36: talked over me or dismissed my ideas, particularly when compared to my younger male colleagues. I\nLine 7, 19:01:36: was also consistently passed over for promotions despite having experience and qualifications\nLine 8, 19:01:36: comparable to others who got promoted.\nLine 9, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you be specific about which colleagues treated you this way and provide\nLine 10, 19:01:36: specific examples of situations where these incidents occurred?\nLine 11, 19:01:36: Witness: One specific example would be the marketing campaign for the new product launch in 2023. I\nLine 12, 19:01:36: put significant effort into developing design concepts, but they were ultimately disregarded without any\nLine 13, 19:01:36: explanation. My male colleague's design, which was very similar to mine, was ultimately chosen.\nLine 14, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: Did you ever report any of these incidents to your supervisor or anyone else at Acme?\nLine 15, 19:01:36: Witness: I once mentioned feeling undervalued to my supervisor, but they brushed it off, suggesting I\nLine 16, 19:01:36: needed to \"work harder to prove myself.\" I wasn't comfortable bringing it up further after that.\nLine 17, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: Did you decide to leave Acme voluntarily, or were you terminated?\nLine 18, 19:01:36: Witness: When they announced another promotion I felt qualified for, but was once again passed over\nLine 19, 19:01:36: without explanation, I decided it was time to find a new position where I felt valued and respected.\nLine 20, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you confirm that your decision to leave Acme was solely based on not\nLine 21, 19:01:36: receiving the promotion, and not due to other factors like job performance or personal reasons?\nLine 22, 19:01:36: Witness: To the best of my knowledge, yes. It became clear to me that further advancement\nLine 23, 19:01:36: opportunities within the company were unlikely.\nLine 24, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: That's all my questions at this time.\nLine 25, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, during your time at Acme, did you ever receive any negative performance\nLine 26, 19:01:36: reviews or warnings related to your work performance?\nLine 27, 19:01:36: Witness: No, as mentioned before, my performance reviews were always positive.\nLine 28, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Did you ever attend any diversity and inclusion training offered by Acme during your\nLine 29, 19:01:36: employment?\nLine 30, 19:01:36: Witness: I did participate in the mandatory online training modules, but there weren't any specific\nLine 31, 19:01:36: training sessions related to addressing or reporting potentially discriminatory situations within the\nLine 32, 19:01:36: company.\nLine 33, 19:01:36: Summary\n--- End of Page 3 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 4 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:36: Michael Anderson details specific incidents supporting his feeling of being undervalued based on his\nLine 2, 19:01:36: protected category. He describes colleagues disregarding his ideas and being passed over for\nLine 3, 19:01:36: promotions despite comparable qualifications. He provides a specific example from the 2023 product\nLine 4, 19:01:36: launch where his design was overlooked in favor of a male colleague's similar work. He mentions\nLine 5, 19:01:36: mentioning his concerns to his supervisor but being discouraged from pursuing them. He clarifies his\nLine 6, 19:01:36: decision to leave Acme was due to the lack of advancement opportunities, not performance or personal\nLine 7, 19:01:36: reasons. Ms. Garcia then establishes that Mr. Anderson's performance was consistently good and that\nLine 8, 19:01:36: he participated in available diversity training while at Acme, though specific training for addressing\nLine 9, 19:01:36: potential discrimination was absent.\nLine 10, 19:01:36: Deposition:\nLine 11, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, are you aware of Acme's anti-discrimination policy or how complaints of\nLine 12, 19:01:36: discrimination are addressed within the company?\nLine 13, 19:01:36: Witness: I reviewed the employee handbook, which did explain the existence of an anti-discrimination\nLine 14, 19:01:36: policy. However, I was unsure of the specific complaint process at the time\nLine 15, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you elaborate on why you felt apprehensive about bringing up these\nLine 16, 19:01:36: incidents to your supervisor despite feeling uncomfortable and undervalued?\nLine 17, 19:01:36: Witness: Honestly, there were a few reasons. Firstly, as I mentioned, when I did hint at feeling\nLine 18, 19:01:36: undervalued to my supervisor, their dismissive response discouraged me from further discussions. It\nLine 19, 19:01:36: seemed like they weren't receptive to hearing about any potential issues.\nLine 20, 19:01:36: Secondly, there was a general company culture that made me hesitant to speak up. Younger male\nLine 21, 19:01:36: colleagues often dominated conversations and presentations, and there weren't many women in senior\nLine 22, 19:01:36: positions within the marketing department. It felt like my voice wouldn't be heard or even worse, that\nLine 23, 19:01:36: bringing forward complaints might lead to retaliation or hinder my career further.\nLine 24, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Did you notice any specific instances of retaliation against other employees who may have\nLine 25, 19:01:36: raised complaints or concerns about work environment issues?\nLine 26, 19:01:36: Witness: While I can't say for sure, there was one colleague, Sarah Lopez, who openly challenged gender\nLine 27, 19:01:36: bias during a department meeting but was subsequently given less desirable project assignments\nLine 28, 19:01:36: compared to her male colleagues. This incident definitely reinforced my concerns about potentially\nLine 29, 19:01:36: facing a similar situation.**\nLine 30, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: Objection, speculation about an unrelated case is irrelevant to the present matter.\nLine 31, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Withdrawn. Mr. Anderson, did you ever discuss your concerns about potential bias or lack of\nLine 32, 19:01:36: promotion opportunities with any human resources personnel at Acme?\nLine 33, 19:01:36: Witness: No, I didn't. As I mentioned before, the lack of clarity on the specific complaint process\nLine 34, 19:01:36: combined with the overall culture discouraged me from pursuing that route.\nLine 35, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, since leaving Acme, have you sought employment elsewhere?\n--- End of Page 4 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 5 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, I am currently employed at a different company and feel much more valued and respected\nLine 2, 19:01:37: in my current role. The work environment is significantly more inclusive, and I regularly receive positive\nLine 3, 19:01:37: feedback and opportunities for professional development.\nLine 4, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, how has your experience at Acme impacted you personally and\nLine 5, 19:01:37: professionally?\nLine 6, 19:01:37: Witness: It was definitely a frustrating and discouraging experience. It felt like my hard work and\nLine 7, 19:01:37: qualifications weren't being recognized fairly, leading to some self-doubt and a sense of being\nLine 8, 19:01:37: undervalued. However, finding a new and positive work environment has helped me rebuild my\nLine 9, 19:01:37: confidence and refocus on my career goals.\nLine 10, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: I have no further questions.\nLine 11, 19:01:37: Summary\nLine 12, 19:01:37: This segment explores Mr. Anderson's reasons for not formally complaining despite feeling undervalued.\nLine 13, 19:01:37: He reiterates his supervisor's dismissive response and the perceived lack of receptiveness within the\nLine 14, 19:01:37: company culture. He describes a specific instance where a colleague who challenged gender bias faced\nLine 15, 19:01:37: negative consequences, reinforcing his fear of retaliation. He clarifies that he didn't pursue HR due to\nLine 16, 19:01:37: unclear procedures and the discouraging company culture. Finally, he highlights his positive experience\nLine 17, 19:01:37: at a new company, emphasizing feelings of value, inclusion, and professional growth in contrast to his\nLine 18, 19:01:37: experience at Acme. He concludes by acknowledging the frustration and self-doubt from Acme but also\nLine 19, 19:01:37: the positive impact of finding a supportive work environment.\nLine 20, 19:01:37: Deposition\nLine 21, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: I have one final question. Mr. Anderson, is there anything else you would like to add\nLine 22, 19:01:37: regarding your experience at Acme Corporation?\nLine 23, 19:01:37: Witness: Just that I hope by sharing my story, it can contribute to fostering a more diverse and inclusive\nLine 24, 19:01:37: work environment at Acme for future employees. Everyone deserves to feel valued and respected in\nLine 25, 19:01:37: their workplace, regardless of their [protected category].\nLine 26, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Interesting point, Mr. Anderson. Ms. Garcia, while you have no further questions, I'd like\nLine 27, 19:01:37: to explore some aspects of Mr. Anderson's experience further before concluding the deposition.\nLine 28, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: No objection. Please proceed, Mr. Thompson.\nLine 29, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, you mentioned feeling unsure about the specific complaint process at\nLine 30, 19:01:37: Acme. Did you take any steps to learn more about it after your meeting with your supervisor?\nLine 31, 19:01:37: Witness: No, I didn't feel comfortable approaching my supervisor again after their dismissive response.\nLine 32, 19:01:37: Additionally, I recall the employee handbook being quite lengthy, and finding specific information about\nLine 33, 19:01:37: the complaint process proved difficult at the time.\n--- End of Page 5 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 6 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: You mentioned a colleague, Sarah Lopez, who voiced concerns about gender bias. Did\nLine 2, 19:01:37: you ever speak to her directly about her experience and the alleged retaliation she faced?\nLine 3, 19:01:37: Witness: Briefly, yes. We expressed our mutual frustrations and the feeling of being undervalued within\nLine 4, 19:01:37: the department. However, we were both hesitant to pursue any formal complaints due to the\nLine 5, 19:01:37: aforementioned concerns about the company culture and potential retaliation.\nLine 6, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Did you ever discuss the issue of lack of promotion opportunities with any other\nLine 7, 19:01:37: colleagues, particularly women in the marketing department?\nLine 8, 19:01:37: Witness: Not directly. While there were a few women colleagues in the department, none of them were\nLine 9, 19:01:37: in senior positions. The general environment discouraged open communication about potentially\nLine 10, 19:01:37: sensitive topics like discrimination.\nLine 11, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Thompson, I object to leading the witness. Can you rephrase your question and allow\nLine 12, 19:01:37: Mr. Anderson to answer in his own words?\nLine 13, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Apologies, Ms. Garcia. Mr. Anderson, to clarify, did you have any informal conversations\nLine 14, 19:01:37: with other colleagues about your concerns regarding promotion opportunities or potential gender bias\nLine 15, 19:01:37: within the marketing department at Acme?\nLine 16, 19:01:37: Witness: There weren't any specific discussions about promotions or bias, but the general atmosphere\nLine 17, 19:01:37: around the lack of female representation in senior positions was a frequent topic of quiet observation\nLine 18, 19:01:37: amongst some female colleagues. We felt implicit pressure to work harder and prove ourselves more\nLine 19, 19:01:37: than our male colleagues, but reaching leadership positions seemed like an increasingly distant\nLine 20, 19:01:37: prospect.\nLine 21, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you elaborate on what kind of \"pressure\" you felt, and was there any\nLine 22, 19:01:37: specific instance or behavior from colleagues or superiors that made you feel this way?\nLine 23, 19:01:37: Summary\nLine 24, 19:01:37: In the concluding segment, Mr. Anderson expresses hope that his experience can contribute to a more\nLine 25, 19:01:37: inclusive work environment at Acme. Mr. Thompson then delves deeper into specific aspects of Mr.\nLine 26, 19:01:37: Anderson's experience:\nLine 27, 19:01:37: Complaint process: Mr. Anderson cites discomfort following his supervisor's reaction and difficulty\nLine 28, 19:01:37: navigating the lengthy employee handbook as reasons for not seeking further information.\nLine 29, 19:01:37: Colleague's experience: He mentions briefly discussing his frustrations and concerns with Sarah Lopez\nLine 30, 19:01:37: but clarifies their shared hesitation to pursue formal complaints due to company culture concerns.\nLine 31, 19:01:37: Promotion opportunities and gender bias: He explains the lack of open communication about these\nLine 32, 19:01:37: issues and feeling unspoken pressure due to the absence of women in senior positions, though no\nLine 33, 19:01:37: specific discussions on bias occurred.\nLine 34, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia objects to a leading question about bias, and Mr. Thompson rephrases, allowing Mr.\nLine 35, 19:01:37: Anderson to clarify further. He explains the silent observation among female colleagues of the lack of\n--- End of Page 6 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 7 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:37: female leadership and the perceived need to overachieve compared to male colleagues. Ms. Garcia\nLine 2, 19:01:37: requests further details about the pressure felt by Mr. Anderson.\nLine 3, 19:01:37: Deposition\nLine 4, 19:01:37: Witness: It wasn't any direct confrontation or statement, but more of a subtle feeling arising from\nLine 5, 19:01:37: observing the lack of female representation in leadership roles combined with certain comments about\nLine 6, 19:01:37: needing to \"work harder\" or \"prove myself\" despite my consistent positive performance reviews.\nLine 7, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Thank you, Mr. Anderson. These are valuable insights. Do you have any further\nLine 8, 19:01:37: questions, Ms. Garcia?\nLine 9, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: (after reviewing her notes) I have a few follow-up questions for clarification. However, due\nLine 10, 19:01:37: to the time constraints, I would like to schedule a follow-up session at your earliest convenience, Mr.\nLine 11, 19:01:37: Thompson, to continue exploring specific details and potential evidence.\nLine 12, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: No objection. Mr. Anderson, are you available for a follow-up session within the next\nLine 13, 19:01:37: week?\nLine 14, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, I am available. Please let me know the details when you've scheduled it\nLine 15, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, since our last session, have you had any time to review Acme\nLine 16, 19:01:37: Corporation's employee handbook pertaining to the complaint process for potential discrimination?\nLine 17, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, I have.\nLine 18, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Can you briefly describe the steps outlined in the handbook for filing a complaint based\nLine 19, 19:01:37: on potential discrimination?\nLine 20, 19:01:37: Witness: The handbook mentioned employees could submit a written complaint to the Human\nLine 21, 19:01:37: Resources department or verbally report it to an HR representative or any manager. However, specific\nLine 22, 19:01:37: details about the investigation process or resolution options were quite vague.\nLine 23, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, did the employee handbook specify who constitutes a \"manager\" authorized\nLine 24, 19:01:37: to receive such initial verbal complaints?\nLine 25, 19:01:37: Witness: No, it didn't provide any specific details about which managers were included in that definition\nLine 26, 19:01:37: or if all managers were authorized to receive such reports.\nLine 27, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, you previously mentioned frustration with receiving similar design\nLine 28, 19:01:37: concepts to yours being chosen over your own work while working at Acme. Do you still have copies of\nLine 29, 19:01:37: these original design concepts and the final versions ultimately used?\nLine 30, 19:01:37: Witness: Unfortunately, I didn't retain individual copies of every design iteration. However, I did\nLine 31, 19:01:37: maintain some preliminary sketches and digital drafts from several projects, including the one discussed\nLine 32, 19:01:37: earlier related to the 2023 product launch campaign.\nLine 33, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Would you be willing to provide these materials as potential evidence in this case?\nLine 34, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, I can bring them to the next session.\n--- End of Page 7 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 8 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, are you aware of other colleagues who may have retained copies of their\nLine 2, 19:01:37: rejected design projects or drafts during their employment at Acme?\nLine 3, 19:01:37: Witness: I'm not certain, but I remember several colleagues raising concerns about the inconsistent\nLine 4, 19:01:37: feedback and selection process for design concepts. It's possible some of them might have kept records\nLine 5, 19:01:37: for their own reference.\nLine 6, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: We will look into that possibility. Mr. Anderson, during your time at Acme, did you ever\nLine 7, 19:01:37: meet or hear about any employees who filed official complaints based on experiencing discrimination?\nLine 8, 19:01:37: Witness: Not officially. As mentioned earlier, there was an underlying lack of transparency and open\nLine 9, 19:01:37: communication around potentially sensitive topics like discrimination. Therefore, it was difficult to know\nLine 10, 19:01:37: for sure.\nLine 11, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, did you receive any additional training or workshops related to diversity and\nLine 12, 19:01:37: inclusion since leaving Acme Corporation?\nLine 13, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, my current employer offers comprehensive training programs and workshops regarding\nLine 14, 19:01:37: diversity and inclusion as part of their ongoing commitment to a fair and equitable work environment.\nLine 15, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Do you find these additional training programs and the overall work environment at\nLine 16, 19:01:37: your current company to be beneficial compared to your experience at Acme?\nLine 17, 19:01:37: Witness: Absolutely. The focus on creating a safe space for open communication, valuing diverse\nLine 18, 19:01:37: perspectives, and providing equal opportunities for growth has been incredibly positive and\nLine 19, 19:01:37: empowering.\nLine 20, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: No further questions at this time.\nLine 21, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, as mentioned previously, we would like you to bring copies of the design\nLine 22, 19:01:37: materials you retained for the next session. Additionally, I may reach out to inquire about potential\nLine 23, 19:01:37: colleagues who might have kept similar records. Is that alright?\nLine 24, 19:01:37: Witness: That's perfectly fine. Please let me know if you need anything else in the meantime.\nLine 25, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, one final question before we adjourn. You mentioned feeling hesitant to\nLine 26, 19:01:37: bring up your concerns to your supervisor after their dismissive response. Did their reaction specifically\nLine 27, 19:01:37: mention any consequences of raising the potential bias issue?\nLine 28, 19:01:37: Witness: Not directly. There wasn't an explicit threat of any sort. However, their dismissive tone and the\nLine 29, 19:01:37: implication that my concerns weren't valid created an atmosphere where I felt further discussion would\nLine 30, 19:01:37: be futile and potentially disadvantageous.\nLine 31, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Objection, speculation about the witness's interpretation of a supervisor's tone is not based\nLine 32, 19:01:37: on facts.\nLine 33, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Reframing, Mr. Anderson. How did your supervisor's response make you feel about the\nLine 34, 19:01:37: potential consequences of reporting your concerns?\n--- End of Page 8 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 9 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:38: Witness: Their response discouraged me and made me feel unheard. It conveyed the impression that my\nLine 2, 19:01:38: concerns about potential bias wouldn't be taken seriously and could potentially hinder my career\nLine 3, 19:01:38: progression within the company.\nLine 4, 19:01:38: Summary\nLine 5, 19:01:38: The concluding segment addresses further details and sets the stage for a follow-up session:\nLine 6, 19:01:38: Complaint process: Mr. Anderson reviews the handbook and describes the outlined steps for filing a\nLine 7, 19:01:38: complaint, noting the vagueness regarding investigation and resolution. Ms. Garcia highlights the lack of\nLine 8, 19:01:38: clarity on who qualifies as a \"manager\" authorized to receive initial verbal reports.\nLine 9, 19:01:38: Design concepts: Mr. Anderson clarifies he still possesses some preliminary sketches and drafts,\nLine 10, 19:01:38: including those from the 2023 product launch, and agrees to provide them as potential evidence. Mr.\nLine 11, 19:01:38: Thompson expresses interest in exploring the possibility of other colleagues retaining similar materials.\nLine 12, 19:01:38: Official complaints: Mr. Anderson reiterates the lack of knowledge about any official discrimination\nLine 13, 19:01:38: complaints at Acme due to the previously mentioned culture of secrecy.\nLine 14, 19:01:38: Current company: Mr. Anderson confirms receiving additional diversity and inclusion training at his\nLine 15, 19:01:38: current company. He emphasizes the positive aspects of his new work environment, highlighting open\nLine 16, 19:01:38: communication, valuing diverse perspectives, and equal opportunities, contrasting it with his experience\nLine 17, 19:01:38: at Acme.\nLine 18, 19:01:38: Follow-up: Both parties agree to a follow-up session. Mr. Thompson clarifies his intention to request the\nLine 19, 19:01:38: design materials and potentially contact other colleagues. Ms. Garcia objects to the witness's\nLine 20, 19:01:38: interpretation of his supervisor's tone, leading Mr. Thompson to rephrase the question, to which Mr.\nLine 21, 19:01:38: Anderson reiterates feeling discouraged and unheard, fearing his concerns wouldn't be taken seriously\nLine 22, 19:01:38: and could hinder his career.\nLine 23, 19:01:38: Deposition\nLine 24, 19:01:38: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Thompson, I believe we've covered the essential topics for today. However, as these are\nLine 25, 19:01:38: complex claims, I would appreciate the opportunity to review the transcript and potentially ask further\nLine 26, 19:01:38: questions at a future session, should any need arise.\nLine 27, 19:01:38: Mr. Thompson: No objection. Mr. Anderson, as Ms. Garcia mentioned, we appreciate your willingness to\nLine 28, 19:01:38: cooperate and provide additional materials. We will be in touch to schedule a follow-up session if\nLine 29, 19:01:38: needed.\nLine 30, 19:01:38: Witness: Understood.\nLine 31, 19:01:38: Summary\nLine 32, 19:01:38: The deposition concludes with Ms. Garcia expressing a desire to review the transcript and potentially\nLine 33, 19:01:38: ask further questions in a future session if needed. Mr. Thompson agrees, and both thank Mr. Anderson\nLine 34, 19:01:38: for his cooperation and willingness to provide additional materials. Mr. Anderson acknowledges their\nLine 35, 19:01:38: communication and awaits further information regarding a potential follow-up session.\n--- End of Page 9 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 10 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:38: Deposition\nLine 2, 19:01:38: MILLER: A driver is obligated to pay attention to the road and yield to other drivers when required. Let\nLine 3, 19:01:38: me take you back to what happened on April 20th, 2022. The Defendant, who was an attorney for the\nLine 4, 19:01:38: IRS, was driving her usual route to work. She drove down Annapolis Road to take a left onto another\nLine 5, 19:01:38: road.\nLine 6, 19:01:38: (Could we have the next slide, please?) She was driving down this road\u2026 can everyone see this? She\nLine 7, 19:01:38: stopped at a light on a clear day. While stopped, she reached down to find her parking pass.\nLine 8, 19:01:38: DEFENSE LAWYER: May we approach?\nLine 9, 19:01:38: THE COURT: Yes.\nLine 10, 19:01:38: BENCH CONFERENCE\nLine 11, 19:01:38: (Bench Conference begins \u2013 10:26:39m.)\nLine 12, 19:01:38: (The parties approach the bench for a discussion.)\nLine 13, 19:01:38: THE COURT: By court ruling, liability has been established. The focus of this case is only on damages. I\nLine 14, 19:01:38: understand why we\u2019re discussing these details, but it\u2019s about damages.\nLine 15, 19:01:38: MILLER: I\u2019m setting the scene for the accident because her damages are part of the accident narrative.\nLine 16, 19:01:38: DEFENSE LAWYER: We\u2019re only discussing the fact that an accident happened and a person was injured.\nLine 17, 19:01:38: The details about reaching and negligence seem to be evidence of liability.\nLine 18, 19:01:38: THE COURT: I understand. It\u2019s your opening statement, so I\u2019ll give you some leeway.\nLine 19, 19:01:38: MILLER: I\u2019m just providing context. I\u2019ll be getting into the damages soon.\nLine 20, 19:01:38: THE COURT: Alright.\nLine 21, 19:01:38: (Bench Conference concluded \u2013 10:27:32 m.)\nLine 22, 19:01:38: (The parties return to their places.)\nLine 23, 19:01:38: MILLER: The Defendant heard a horn beep and took a left turn. She didn\u2019t see the Plaintiff, who had the\nLine 24, 19:01:38: right of way, coming from the opposite direction. Due to the collision, the Plaintiff\u2019s ankle was broken\nLine 25, 19:01:38: and required surgery.\nLine 26, 19:01:38: Take a look at these images. The first one shows her ankle before surgery, the second one after surgery.\nLine 27, 19:01:38: Today, she still has 15 screws and three plates in her ankle. She will never be able to run again and\nLine 28, 19:01:38: standing for extended periods of time is difficult.\nLine 29, 19:01:38: We\u2019ve brought this case before you because of the harm caused to the Plaintiff. We needed to agree\nLine 30, 19:01:38: that the Defendant was at fault for the accident, which she has accepted. We also had to understand the\nLine 31, 19:01:38: extent and implications of the Plaintiff\u2019s damages, not just the initial injury and surgery, but also its long-\nLine 32, 19:01:38: term impact on her life.\nLine 33, 19:01:38: To do this, we spoke to her doctors, her husband, her friends, and even her employer. One of her\nLine 34, 19:01:38: doctors is going to talk to you.\n--- End of Page 10 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 11 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:38: This is the guy to see if something awful like this is going to happen to your ankle. He received an Ivy\nLine 2, 19:01:38: League education and, at one point, was the chief of foot and ankle orthopedic injuries at Johns\nLine 3, 19:01:38: Hopkins. He consults for the Baltimore Orioles. His resume, I want to say, is as long as your arm, but it\u2019s\nLine 4, 19:01:38: actually a lot longer than that.\nLine 5, 19:01:38: We\u2019re going to bring him to talk to you guys, in a very 2023 way. It\u2019s going to be by videotape, so his\nLine 6, 19:01:38: testimony will be by videotape, but it holds the same force as if it was at trial, and he came here to see\nLine 7, 19:01:38: us. And, of course, my partner Laura Zois and the defense attorney had an opportunity to ask him\nLine 8, 19:01:38: questions.\nLine 9, 19:01:38: He\u2019s going to tell you she still has 15 screws and three plates in her ankle holding everything together.\nLine 10, 19:01:38: The problem with that is that it creates a breeding ground for arthritis, and this 33-year-old woman\nLine 11, 19:01:38: already has the signs of arthritis. At some point, she\u2019s going to need what\u2019s called a fusion, which will\nLine 12, 19:01:38: stabilize her ankle. The bad news is, you can\u2019t move it once it locks, so you no longer have the ability to\nLine 13, 19:01:38: bend.\nLine 14, 19:01:38: This trial is about the harms and losses that she has suffered and endured as the result of this accident.\nLine 15, 19:01:38: This is not a case about sympathy. You should not award her damages because you feel sorry for her.\nLine 16, 19:01:38: You\u2019re going to hear about how the accident has impacted her professional and personal life.\nLine 17, 19:01:38: At the time of the crash, they were a very young family. They were an energetic family. This is an active\nLine 18, 19:01:38: family with four kids doing everything you can imagine, Six Flags, the park. They would run together.\nLine 19, 19:01:38: They played basketball together. They traveled everywhere, New York, Baltimore, Washington, DC. They\nLine 20, 19:01:38: were just a very active family.\nLine 21, 19:01:38: And she also had a vibrant social life. She was a hairstylist, and she loved that job. It was her social outlet\nLine 22, 19:01:38: beside her kids. She would do the church choir every Wednesday, and still found times to go out and see\nLine 23, 19:01:38: her family. She\u2019s still fighting with her family, but it\u2019s hard.\nLine 24, 19:01:38: She can\u2019t work as a hairstylist anymore. So what did she do? She went back to school to the University\nLine 25, 19:01:38: of Maryland. She\u2019s working, getting very close to getting her degree. She\u2019s still fighting. She has four kids\nLine 26, 19:01:38: they\u2019re chasing around.\nLine 27, 19:01:38: Let\u2019s go back and talk about how it ended up. Let\u2019s talk about the accident. She had this awful crash and\nLine 28, 19:01:38: needed emergency surgery where they put in these screws. She had a nine-month-old baby, along with\nLine 29, 19:01:38: three other kids. She and the two girls, the younger ones, went to live with her mom. Her mom took\nLine 30, 19:01:38: care of her and the girls, while her husband took care of the other kids.\nLine 31, 19:01:38: This has been a massive disruption to their lives. The accident has completely changed her life, and it\u2019s\nLine 32, 19:01:38: reflected in every facet of her day-to-day. Her job, her family life, her hobbies, everything she used to\nLine 33, 19:01:38: take pleasure in has been impacted in one way or another. And the evidence in this case will show these\nLine 34, 19:01:38: changes are likely to persist for the rest of her life.\nLine 35, 19:01:38: We ask you to consider the totality of these changes, the persistent harm and loss she\u2019s suffered and\nLine 36, 19:01:38: will continue to suffer, as a direct result of the accident. We ask you to consider these when coming to a\nLine 37, 19:01:38: decision in this case.\n--- End of Page 11 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 12 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:38: This accident, however, led to an upheaval in their lives. About a month after the accident, she managed\nLine 2, 19:01:38: to return home with the kids. Her mother, an FDA employee, took three months off work to care for her,\nLine 3, 19:01:38: her daughter, and her grandchildren. The accident wreaked havoc on their lives.\nLine 4, 19:01:38: She endured six months of rigorous physical therapy and another operation. While it was painful and\nLine 5, 19:01:38: difficult, the effort was worthwhile as it improved her condition, especially her ankle, though we wish\nLine 6, 19:01:38: she had recovered more.\nLine 7, 19:01:38: As we delve into this case, it\u2019s about the harm and losses experienced. We will ask you to make amends\nLine 8, 19:01:38: where possible and provide compensation for the irreparable harm. The damages can be categorized\nLine 9, 19:01:38: into three parts: her medical bills, the post-accident trauma suffered by her and her family, and the pain\nLine 10, 19:01:38: she will endure for the expected next 45 years of her life.\nLine 11, 19:01:38: She was a spontaneous person, fond of making impromptu plans like going to Virginia Beach over the\nLine 12, 19:01:38: weekend or heading to the park. Now, every activity revolves around her ability to reach there, her\nLine 13, 19:01:38: mobility, and whether she can tolerate the pain during the trip. This situation has affected her and her\nLine 14, 19:01:38: four kids, as well as her husband.\nLine 15, 19:01:38: The court wants to clarify that the evidence and testimonies from the witness stand are what will\nLine 16, 19:01:38: control your deliberations. Opening statements and closing arguments of lawyers do not constitute\nLine 17, 19:01:38: evidence.\nLine 18, 19:01:38: This case is not just about the suffering of their children or her husband. It\u2019s about the impact of their\nLine 19, 19:01:38: suffering on her. We will ask you to consider an amount that may seem high at the beginning. But we\nLine 20, 19:01:38: believe that after hearing all the evidence, you\u2019ll find it to be a fair compensation for her losses and\nLine 21, 19:01:38: harm. The amount we suggest is $1.1 million.\nLine 22, 19:01:38: Defense Opening Statement\nLine 23, 19:01:38: Regarding the defendant, they acknowledge the responsibility for the accident and that it was their\nLine 24, 19:01:38: fault. The case is for you to determine the appropriate damages. The injury is severe, and they ask for an\nLine 25, 19:01:38: extraordinary amount of compensation.\nLine 26, 19:01:38: She broke her ankle, which was repaired surgically with plates and screws. There was a second surgery\nLine 27, 19:01:38: due to loosening of the screws, which were then removed. She attended physical therapy, which\nLine 28, 19:01:38: improved her ability to move her ankle. Whether she will need surgery in the future is uncertain.\nLine 29, 19:01:38: The past medical expenses are around $36,505, which we don\u2019t contest. Her lost wages due to the\nLine 30, 19:01:38: accident are around $3,400 to $3,500. These are not the focal points of this case. The main issue is the\nLine 31, 19:01:38: amount to be awarded for non-economic damages, for which we request something fair, reasonable,\nLine 32, 19:01:38: and sensible.\nLine 33, 19:01:38: Thank you for your time and attention, and we hope to conclude this case promptly.\nLine 34, 19:01:38: Testimony of Victim\u2019s Husband\nLine 35, 19:01:38: Mr. Miller: Good morning. Can I have your address?\nLine 36, 19:01:38: SJ: Certainly.\nLine 37, 19:01:38: Mr. Miller: How long have you lived at that address?\n--- End of Page 12 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 13 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: SJ: I bought the house in 2003, so it\u2019s been approximately ten years.\nLine 2, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Who lives there with you?\nLine 3, 19:01:39: SJ: My wife, and our four children.\nLine 4, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Can you tell the jury how old your children are and their names?\nLine 5, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes. My children are 13, and the others are\u2026\nLine 6, 19:01:39: The Honorable Judge: Please continue.\nLine 7, 19:01:39: SJ: \u2026five, and three.\nLine 8, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: I understand. And for some background, what do you do for a living?\nLine 9, 19:01:39: SJ: I\u2019m currently the general manager at Oreck Clean Home Center.\nLine 10, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: And where are these locations?\nLine 11, 19:01:39: SJ: We have six locations in Maryland and Virginia.\nLine 12, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: What are your responsibilities at work?\nLine 13, 19:01:39: SJ: I oversee all six stores and manage one of them.\nLine 14, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Can you describe your work schedule?\nLine 15, 19:01:39: SJ: I work Monday through Saturday, from 10:00 am to 7:00 pm. Often, I work seven days a week which\nLine 16, 19:01:39: means working on Sundays from 12:00 pm to 5:00 pm.\nLine 17, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: How do you feel about those hours?\nLine 18, 19:01:39: SJ: They are long, but I need to work to support my family.\nLine 19, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: How long have you known your wife?\nLine 20, 19:01:39: SJ: I met her in 1993, she was my sister\u2019s best friend.\nLine 21, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: You mean your wife was your sister\u2019s best friend?\nLine 22, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes, I apologize for the confusion. She was indeed my sister\u2019s best friend.\nLine 23, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Let\u2019s move to another topic. Do you remember the car accident your wife was in 2022?\nLine 24, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes, I do.\nLine 25, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Prior to the accident, can you describe your household?\nLine 26, 19:01:39: SJ: Our household was what I would consider the perfect life. My wife and children were happy and\nLine 27, 19:01:39: always engaged in activities. We used to take vacations and attend family reunions.\nLine 28, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Was your wife a spontaneous person or a planner?\nLine 29, 19:01:39: SJ: She was more spontaneous, always ready to take on new activities.\n--- End of Page 13 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 14 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Could you describe her for the jury?\nLine 2, 19:01:39: SJ: She is always happy, loves socializing and helping people. She attended choir rehearsal, Bible study\nLine 3, 19:01:39: every week, and also took care of our four children.\nLine 4, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: What was her job at the time of the crash?\nLine 5, 19:01:39: SJ: She was the assistant manager of a hair salon.\nLine 6, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Did she enjoy her work?\nLine 7, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes, she loved her work. It was part of her identity.\nLine 8, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Did your wife\u2019s demeanor change after the car accident?\nLine 9, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes, after the accident everything changed. Our family life and activity level changed significantly. She\nLine 10, 19:01:39: used to take the children to sporting events and practice basketball. Now, she can\u2019t do these activities.\nLine 11, 19:01:39: She no longer goes on family vacations. My two older sons call her \u201cboring\u201d now because of her reduced\nLine 12, 19:01:39: activity level. The accident has restricted her capabilities and as a result, she can\u2019t even do simple tasks\nLine 13, 19:01:39: like carrying laundry baskets or standing up to cook. Our family life has changed drastically since the\nLine 14, 19:01:39: accident.\nLine 15, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Has your wife gone back to work since the accident?\nLine 16, 19:01:39: SJ: She tried to help a friend out a couple of months ago at her hair salon, but it ended with her in a lot\nLine 17, 19:01:39: of pain due to the swelling in her ankle.\nLine 18, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: I have here a picture you received from your wife. Is this the picture she sent you?\nLine 19, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Can you tell us how your wife\u2019s personal social life has been affected since the crash?\nLine 20, 19:01:39: SJ: Her social life has indeed changed significantly. Before the accident, she would regularly go out with\nLine 21, 19:01:39: friends, engage in dancing, and other social activities. However, the constant pain and discomfort after\nLine 22, 19:01:39: the crash have made such activities impossible. Her social life is definitely not the same as before.\nLine 23, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: You mentioned earlier about her job. Was she able to resume work post the crash?\nLine 24, 19:01:39: SJ: She attempted to return to work, but the persistent pain made it unmanageable, particularly the\nLine 25, 19:01:39: long-standing hours. Eventually, she was forced to leave her job.\nLine 26, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: How has this situation impacted your family\u2019s finances?\nLine 27, 19:01:39: SJ: The impact has been substantial. She held the position of an assistant manager at a hair salon,\nLine 28, 19:01:39: bringing in a significant income. Now, with my single income, managing expenses for our four children\nLine 29, 19:01:39: and her medical bills has been strenuous.\nLine 30, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Besides the financial struggle, can you share how your relationship with your wife has\nLine 31, 19:01:39: evolved post the accident?\nLine 32, 19:01:39: SJ: Our relationship has undeniably been affected. She isn\u2019t the same person she was before the crash.\nLine 33, 19:01:39: Her constant pain and fatigue, coupled with frustration, have been hard on both of us.\nLine 34, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: And your children? How have they been coping with all these changes?\n--- End of Page 14 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 15 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: SJ: Our children have had to make significant adjustments. They miss the mother they had before the\nLine 2, 19:01:39: crash, not understanding why she can\u2019t engage in the activities she used to do with them. My older\nLine 3, 19:01:39: sons, in particular, have had to step up, assisting more with household chores. It\u2019s been a lot for them\nLine 4, 19:01:39: too.\nLine 5, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Finally, could you share your hopes for your wife\u2019s future?\nLine 6, 19:01:39: SJ: My biggest hope is for her to find relief from her pain and regain some semblance of normalcy.

Ms. Miller, were you present at the intersection of Main Street and Maple\nLine 10, 19:01:36: Avenue on July 15th, 2023, at approximately 3:00 pm?\nLine 11, 19:01:36: Witness: Yes, I was. I was waiting at the red light on Maple Avenue, southbound, facing east.\nLine 12, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: Did you witness any accidents at that intersection at that time?\nLine 13, 19:01:36: Witness: Yes, I did. I saw a car traveling westbound on Main Street, which I believe was a blue sedan, run\nLine 14, 19:01:36: the red light and collide with a car traveling northbound on Maple Avenue, which I believe was a white\nLine 15, 19:01:36: SUV.\nLine 16, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: Can you describe the collision in more detail?\nLine 17, 19:01:36: Witness: The blue sedan seemed to be traveling at a high speed and didn't slow down or attempt to stop\nLine 18, 19:01:36: at the red light. It hit the white SUV directly on the driver's side. The impact was quite forceful, and both\nLine 19, 19:01:36: cars spun around significantly.\nLine 20, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: Ms. Miller, you mentioned the blue sedan was traveling at a high speed. How fast would you\nLine 21, 19:01:36: say it was going?\nLine 22, 19:01:36: Witness: It's difficult to say for sure, but it appeared to be going much faster than the posted speed\nLine 23, 19:01:36: limit, which is 35 miles per hour.\nLine 24, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: Did you see the driver of either vehicle at any point?\nLine 25, 19:01:36: Witness: No, I didn't.\nLine 26, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: Ms. Miller, did you notice anything unusual about the driver's behavior in the blue sedan\nLine 27, 19:01:36: before the accident?\nLine 28, 19:01:36: Witness: It's hard to say. Everything happened very quickly, but the car did seem to be swerving slightly\nLine 29, 19:01:36: just before the collision.\nLine 30, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: Ms. Miller, did you call the police or offer assistance to anyone involved in the accident?\nLine 31, 19:01:36: Witness: Yes, I immediately called 911 and stayed at the scene until the police arrived.\nLine 32, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: Did you speak to anyone else who may have witnessed the accident?\n--- End of Page 1 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 2 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:36: Witness: Yes, I exchanged information with another driver who was stopped next to me on Maple\nLine 2, 19:01:36: Avenue at the time.\nLine 3, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: Do you recall the make and model of the other vehicle that you spoke to?\nLine 4, 19:01:36: Witness: I believe it was a silver Toyota Camry, but I'm not entirely sure.\nLine 5, 19:01:36: Mr. Brown: That's all my questions at this time.\nLine 6, 19:01:36: Mr. Lee: I have no further questions\nLine 7, 19:01:36: Summary:\nLine 8, 19:01:36: The excerpt is from a legal deposition of Michael Anderson, who is under oath to tell the truth. Mr.\nLine 9, 19:01:36: Anderson confirms his employment at Acme Corporation as a graphic designer and details his job duties.\nLine 10, 19:01:36: He also confirms receiving positive performance reviews and never facing disciplinary actions. The\nLine 11, 19:01:36: excerpt ends with a question about witnessing or experiencing any discriminatory situations at Acme.\n--- End of Page 2 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 3 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:36: Deposition:\nLine 2, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Objection, that question calls for legal conclusions from the witness.\nLine 3, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: Withdrawn. Mr. Anderson, please describe any specific incidents or instances at Acme\nLine 4, 19:01:36: that involved your [protected category].\nLine 5, 19:01:36: Witness: There were several things that made me feel uncomfortable. During meetings, colleagues often\nLine 6, 19:01:36: talked over me or dismissed my ideas, particularly when compared to my younger male colleagues. I\nLine 7, 19:01:36: was also consistently passed over for promotions despite having experience and qualifications\nLine 8, 19:01:36: comparable to others who got promoted.\nLine 9, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you be specific about which colleagues treated you this way and provide\nLine 10, 19:01:36: specific examples of situations where these incidents occurred?\nLine 11, 19:01:36: Witness: One specific example would be the marketing campaign for the new product launch in 2023. I\nLine 12, 19:01:36: put significant effort into developing design concepts, but they were ultimately disregarded without any\nLine 13, 19:01:36: explanation. My male colleague's design, which was very similar to mine, was ultimately chosen.\nLine 14, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: Did you ever report any of these incidents to your supervisor or anyone else at Acme?\nLine 15, 19:01:36: Witness: I once mentioned feeling undervalued to my supervisor, but they brushed it off, suggesting I\nLine 16, 19:01:36: needed to \"work harder to prove myself.\" I wasn't comfortable bringing it up further after that.\nLine 17, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: Did you decide to leave Acme voluntarily, or were you terminated?\nLine 18, 19:01:36: Witness: When they announced another promotion I felt qualified for, but was once again passed over\nLine 19, 19:01:36: without explanation, I decided it was time to find a new position where I felt valued and respected.\nLine 20, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you confirm that your decision to leave Acme was solely based on not\nLine 21, 19:01:36: receiving the promotion, and not due to other factors like job performance or personal reasons?\nLine 22, 19:01:36: Witness: To the best of my knowledge, yes. It became clear to me that further advancement\nLine 23, 19:01:36: opportunities within the company were unlikely.\nLine 24, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: That's all my questions at this time.\nLine 25, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, during your time at Acme, did you ever receive any negative performance\nLine 26, 19:01:36: reviews or warnings related to your work performance?\nLine 27, 19:01:36: Witness: No, as mentioned before, my performance reviews were always positive.\nLine 28, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Did you ever attend any diversity and inclusion training offered by Acme during your\nLine 29, 19:01:36: employment?\nLine 30, 19:01:36: Witness: I did participate in the mandatory online training modules, but there weren't any specific\nLine 31, 19:01:36: training sessions related to addressing or reporting potentially discriminatory situations within the\nLine 32, 19:01:36: company.\nLine 33, 19:01:36: Summary\n--- End of Page 3 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 4 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:36: Michael Anderson details specific incidents supporting his feeling of being undervalued based on his\nLine 2, 19:01:36: protected category. He describes colleagues disregarding his ideas and being passed over for\nLine 3, 19:01:36: promotions despite comparable qualifications. He provides a specific example from the 2023 product\nLine 4, 19:01:36: launch where his design was overlooked in favor of a male colleague's similar work. He mentions\nLine 5, 19:01:36: mentioning his concerns to his supervisor but being discouraged from pursuing them. He clarifies his\nLine 6, 19:01:36: decision to leave Acme was due to the lack of advancement opportunities, not performance or personal\nLine 7, 19:01:36: reasons. Ms. Garcia then establishes that Mr. Anderson's performance was consistently good and that\nLine 8, 19:01:36: he participated in available diversity training while at Acme, though specific training for addressing\nLine 9, 19:01:36: potential discrimination was absent.\nLine 10, 19:01:36: Deposition:\nLine 11, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, are you aware of Acme's anti-discrimination policy or how complaints of\nLine 12, 19:01:36: discrimination are addressed within the company?\nLine 13, 19:01:36: Witness: I reviewed the employee handbook, which did explain the existence of an anti-discrimination\nLine 14, 19:01:36: policy. However, I was unsure of the specific complaint process at the time\nLine 15, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you elaborate on why you felt apprehensive about bringing up these\nLine 16, 19:01:36: incidents to your supervisor despite feeling uncomfortable and undervalued?\nLine 17, 19:01:36: Witness: Honestly, there were a few reasons. Firstly, as I mentioned, when I did hint at feeling\nLine 18, 19:01:36: undervalued to my supervisor, their dismissive response discouraged me from further discussions. It\nLine 19, 19:01:36: seemed like they weren't receptive to hearing about any potential issues.\nLine 20, 19:01:36: Secondly, there was a general company culture that made me hesitant to speak up. Younger male\nLine 21, 19:01:36: colleagues often dominated conversations and presentations, and there weren't many women in senior\nLine 22, 19:01:36: positions within the marketing department. It felt like my voice wouldn't be heard or even worse, that\nLine 23, 19:01:36: bringing forward complaints might lead to retaliation or hinder my career further.\nLine 24, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Did you notice any specific instances of retaliation against other employees who may have\nLine 25, 19:01:36: raised complaints or concerns about work environment issues?\nLine 26, 19:01:36: Witness: While I can't say for sure, there was one colleague, Sarah Lopez, who openly challenged gender\nLine 27, 19:01:36: bias during a department meeting but was subsequently given less desirable project assignments\nLine 28, 19:01:36: compared to her male colleagues. This incident definitely reinforced my concerns about potentially\nLine 29, 19:01:36: facing a similar situation.**\nLine 30, 19:01:36: Mr. Thompson: Objection, speculation about an unrelated case is irrelevant to the present matter.\nLine 31, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Withdrawn. Mr. Anderson, did you ever discuss your concerns about potential bias or lack of\nLine 32, 19:01:36: promotion opportunities with any human resources personnel at Acme?\nLine 33, 19:01:36: Witness: No, I didn't. As I mentioned before, the lack of clarity on the specific complaint process\nLine 34, 19:01:36: combined with the overall culture discouraged me from pursuing that route.\nLine 35, 19:01:36: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, since leaving Acme, have you sought employment elsewhere?\n--- End of Page 4 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 5 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, I am currently employed at a different company and feel much more valued and respected\nLine 2, 19:01:37: in my current role. The work environment is significantly more inclusive, and I regularly receive positive\nLine 3, 19:01:37: feedback and opportunities for professional development.\nLine 4, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, how has your experience at Acme impacted you personally and\nLine 5, 19:01:37: professionally?\nLine 6, 19:01:37: Witness: It was definitely a frustrating and discouraging experience. It felt like my hard work and\nLine 7, 19:01:37: qualifications weren't being recognized fairly, leading to some self-doubt and a sense of being\nLine 8, 19:01:37: undervalued. However, finding a new and positive work environment has helped me rebuild my\nLine 9, 19:01:37: confidence and refocus on my career goals.\nLine 10, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: I have no further questions.\nLine 11, 19:01:37: Summary\nLine 12, 19:01:37: This segment explores Mr. Anderson's reasons for not formally complaining despite feeling undervalued.\nLine 13, 19:01:37: He reiterates his supervisor's dismissive response and the perceived lack of receptiveness within the\nLine 14, 19:01:37: company culture. He describes a specific instance where a colleague who challenged gender bias faced\nLine 15, 19:01:37: negative consequences, reinforcing his fear of retaliation. He clarifies that he didn't pursue HR due to\nLine 16, 19:01:37: unclear procedures and the discouraging company culture. Finally, he highlights his positive experience\nLine 17, 19:01:37: at a new company, emphasizing feelings of value, inclusion, and professional growth in contrast to his\nLine 18, 19:01:37: experience at Acme. He concludes by acknowledging the frustration and self-doubt from Acme but also\nLine 19, 19:01:37: the positive impact of finding a supportive work environment.\nLine 20, 19:01:37: Deposition\nLine 21, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: I have one final question. Mr. Anderson, is there anything else you would like to add\nLine 22, 19:01:37: regarding your experience at Acme Corporation?\nLine 23, 19:01:37: Witness: Just that I hope by sharing my story, it can contribute to fostering a more diverse and inclusive\nLine 24, 19:01:37: work environment at Acme for future employees. Everyone deserves to feel valued and respected in\nLine 25, 19:01:37: their workplace, regardless of their [protected category].\nLine 26, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Interesting point, Mr. Anderson. Ms. Garcia, while you have no further questions, I'd like\nLine 27, 19:01:37: to explore some aspects of Mr. Anderson's experience further before concluding the deposition.\nLine 28, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: No objection. Please proceed, Mr. Thompson.\nLine 29, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, you mentioned feeling unsure about the specific complaint process at\nLine 30, 19:01:37: Acme. Did you take any steps to learn more about it after your meeting with your supervisor?\nLine 31, 19:01:37: Witness: No, I didn't feel comfortable approaching my supervisor again after their dismissive response.\nLine 32, 19:01:37: Additionally, I recall the employee handbook being quite lengthy, and finding specific information about\nLine 33, 19:01:37: the complaint process proved difficult at the time.\n--- End of Page 5 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 6 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: You mentioned a colleague, Sarah Lopez, who voiced concerns about gender bias. Did\nLine 2, 19:01:37: you ever speak to her directly about her experience and the alleged retaliation she faced?\nLine 3, 19:01:37: Witness: Briefly, yes. We expressed our mutual frustrations and the feeling of being undervalued within\nLine 4, 19:01:37: the department. However, we were both hesitant to pursue any formal complaints due to the\nLine 5, 19:01:37: aforementioned concerns about the company culture and potential retaliation.\nLine 6, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Did you ever discuss the issue of lack of promotion opportunities with any other\nLine 7, 19:01:37: colleagues, particularly women in the marketing department?\nLine 8, 19:01:37: Witness: Not directly. While there were a few women colleagues in the department, none of them were\nLine 9, 19:01:37: in senior positions. The general environment discouraged open communication about potentially\nLine 10, 19:01:37: sensitive topics like discrimination.\nLine 11, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Thompson, I object to leading the witness. Can you rephrase your question and allow\nLine 12, 19:01:37: Mr. Anderson to answer in his own words?\nLine 13, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Apologies, Ms. Garcia. Mr. Anderson, to clarify, did you have any informal conversations\nLine 14, 19:01:37: with other colleagues about your concerns regarding promotion opportunities or potential gender bias\nLine 15, 19:01:37: within the marketing department at Acme?\nLine 16, 19:01:37: Witness: There weren't any specific discussions about promotions or bias, but the general atmosphere\nLine 17, 19:01:37: around the lack of female representation in senior positions was a frequent topic of quiet observation\nLine 18, 19:01:37: amongst some female colleagues. We felt implicit pressure to work harder and prove ourselves more\nLine 19, 19:01:37: than our male colleagues, but reaching leadership positions seemed like an increasingly distant\nLine 20, 19:01:37: prospect.\nLine 21, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you elaborate on what kind of \"pressure\" you felt, and was there any\nLine 22, 19:01:37: specific instance or behavior from colleagues or superiors that made you feel this way?\nLine 23, 19:01:37: Summary\nLine 24, 19:01:37: In the concluding segment, Mr. Anderson expresses hope that his experience can contribute to a more\nLine 25, 19:01:37: inclusive work environment at Acme. Mr. Thompson then delves deeper into specific aspects of Mr.\nLine 26, 19:01:37: Anderson's experience:\nLine 27, 19:01:37: Complaint process: Mr. Anderson cites discomfort following his supervisor's reaction and difficulty\nLine 28, 19:01:37: navigating the lengthy employee handbook as reasons for not seeking further information.\nLine 29, 19:01:37: Colleague's experience: He mentions briefly discussing his frustrations and concerns with Sarah Lopez\nLine 30, 19:01:37: but clarifies their shared hesitation to pursue formal complaints due to company culture concerns.\nLine 31, 19:01:37: Promotion opportunities and gender bias: He explains the lack of open communication about these\nLine 32, 19:01:37: issues and feeling unspoken pressure due to the absence of women in senior positions, though no\nLine 33, 19:01:37: specific discussions on bias occurred.\nLine 34, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia objects to a leading question about bias, and Mr. Thompson rephrases, allowing Mr.\nLine 35, 19:01:37: Anderson to clarify further. He explains the silent observation among female colleagues of the lack of\n--- End of Page 6 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 7 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:37: female leadership and the perceived need to overachieve compared to male colleagues. Ms. Garcia\nLine 2, 19:01:37: requests further details about the pressure felt by Mr. Anderson.\nLine 3, 19:01:37: Deposition\nLine 4, 19:01:37: Witness: It wasn't any direct confrontation or statement, but more of a subtle feeling arising from\nLine 5, 19:01:37: observing the lack of female representation in leadership roles combined with certain comments about\nLine 6, 19:01:37: needing to \"work harder\" or \"prove myself\" despite my consistent positive performance reviews.\nLine 7, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Thank you, Mr. Anderson. These are valuable insights. Do you have any further\nLine 8, 19:01:37: questions, Ms. Garcia?\nLine 9, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: (after reviewing her notes) I have a few follow-up questions for clarification. However, due\nLine 10, 19:01:37: to the time constraints, I would like to schedule a follow-up session at your earliest convenience, Mr.\nLine 11, 19:01:37: Thompson, to continue exploring specific details and potential evidence.\nLine 12, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: No objection. Mr. Anderson, are you available for a follow-up session within the next\nLine 13, 19:01:37: week?\nLine 14, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, I am available. Please let me know the details when you've scheduled it\nLine 15, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, since our last session, have you had any time to review Acme\nLine 16, 19:01:37: Corporation's employee handbook pertaining to the complaint process for potential discrimination?\nLine 17, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, I have.\nLine 18, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Can you briefly describe the steps outlined in the handbook for filing a complaint based\nLine 19, 19:01:37: on potential discrimination?\nLine 20, 19:01:37: Witness: The handbook mentioned employees could submit a written complaint to the Human\nLine 21, 19:01:37: Resources department or verbally report it to an HR representative or any manager. However, specific\nLine 22, 19:01:37: details about the investigation process or resolution options were quite vague.\nLine 23, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, did the employee handbook specify who constitutes a \"manager\" authorized\nLine 24, 19:01:37: to receive such initial verbal complaints?\nLine 25, 19:01:37: Witness: No, it didn't provide any specific details about which managers were included in that definition\nLine 26, 19:01:37: or if all managers were authorized to receive such reports.\nLine 27, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, you previously mentioned frustration with receiving similar design\nLine 28, 19:01:37: concepts to yours being chosen over your own work while working at Acme. Do you still have copies of\nLine 29, 19:01:37: these original design concepts and the final versions ultimately used?\nLine 30, 19:01:37: Witness: Unfortunately, I didn't retain individual copies of every design iteration. However, I did\nLine 31, 19:01:37: maintain some preliminary sketches and digital drafts from several projects, including the one discussed\nLine 32, 19:01:37: earlier related to the 2023 product launch campaign.\nLine 33, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Would you be willing to provide these materials as potential evidence in this case?\nLine 34, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, I can bring them to the next session.\n--- End of Page 7 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 8 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, are you aware of other colleagues who may have retained copies of their\nLine 2, 19:01:37: rejected design projects or drafts during their employment at Acme?\nLine 3, 19:01:37: Witness: I'm not certain, but I remember several colleagues raising concerns about the inconsistent\nLine 4, 19:01:37: feedback and selection process for design concepts. It's possible some of them might have kept records\nLine 5, 19:01:37: for their own reference.\nLine 6, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: We will look into that possibility. Mr. Anderson, during your time at Acme, did you ever\nLine 7, 19:01:37: meet or hear about any employees who filed official complaints based on experiencing discrimination?\nLine 8, 19:01:37: Witness: Not officially. As mentioned earlier, there was an underlying lack of transparency and open\nLine 9, 19:01:37: communication around potentially sensitive topics like discrimination. Therefore, it was difficult to know\nLine 10, 19:01:37: for sure.\nLine 11, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, did you receive any additional training or workshops related to diversity and\nLine 12, 19:01:37: inclusion since leaving Acme Corporation?\nLine 13, 19:01:37: Witness: Yes, my current employer offers comprehensive training programs and workshops regarding\nLine 14, 19:01:37: diversity and inclusion as part of their ongoing commitment to a fair and equitable work environment.\nLine 15, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Do you find these additional training programs and the overall work environment at\nLine 16, 19:01:37: your current company to be beneficial compared to your experience at Acme?\nLine 17, 19:01:37: Witness: Absolutely. The focus on creating a safe space for open communication, valuing diverse\nLine 18, 19:01:37: perspectives, and providing equal opportunities for growth has been incredibly positive and\nLine 19, 19:01:37: empowering.\nLine 20, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: No further questions at this time.\nLine 21, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, as mentioned previously, we would like you to bring copies of the design\nLine 22, 19:01:37: materials you retained for the next session. Additionally, I may reach out to inquire about potential\nLine 23, 19:01:37: colleagues who might have kept similar records. Is that alright?\nLine 24, 19:01:37: Witness: That's perfectly fine. Please let me know if you need anything else in the meantime.\nLine 25, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, one final question before we adjourn. You mentioned feeling hesitant to\nLine 26, 19:01:37: bring up your concerns to your supervisor after their dismissive response. Did their reaction specifically\nLine 27, 19:01:37: mention any consequences of raising the potential bias issue?\nLine 28, 19:01:37: Witness: Not directly. There wasn't an explicit threat of any sort. However, their dismissive tone and the\nLine 29, 19:01:37: implication that my concerns weren't valid created an atmosphere where I felt further discussion would\nLine 30, 19:01:37: be futile and potentially disadvantageous.\nLine 31, 19:01:37: Ms. Garcia: Objection, speculation about the witness's interpretation of a supervisor's tone is not based\nLine 32, 19:01:37: on facts.\nLine 33, 19:01:37: Mr. Thompson: Reframing, Mr. Anderson. How did your supervisor's response make you feel about the\nLine 34, 19:01:37: potential consequences of reporting your concerns?\n--- End of Page 8 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 9 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:38: Witness: Their response discouraged me and made me feel unheard. It conveyed the impression that my\nLine 2, 19:01:38: concerns about potential bias wouldn't be taken seriously and could potentially hinder my career\nLine 3, 19:01:38: progression within the company.\nLine 4, 19:01:38: Summary\nLine 5, 19:01:38: The concluding segment addresses further details and sets the stage for a follow-up session:\nLine 6, 19:01:38: Complaint process: Mr. Anderson reviews the handbook and describes the outlined steps for filing a\nLine 7, 19:01:38: complaint, noting the vagueness regarding investigation and resolution. Ms. Garcia highlights the lack of\nLine 8, 19:01:38: clarity on who qualifies as a \"manager\" authorized to receive initial verbal reports.\nLine 9, 19:01:38: Design concepts: Mr. Anderson clarifies he still possesses some preliminary sketches and drafts,\nLine 10, 19:01:38: including those from the 2023 product launch, and agrees to provide them as potential evidence. Mr.\nLine 11, 19:01:38: Thompson expresses interest in exploring the possibility of other colleagues retaining similar materials.\nLine 12, 19:01:38: Official complaints: Mr. Anderson reiterates the lack of knowledge about any official discrimination\nLine 13, 19:01:38: complaints at Acme due to the previously mentioned culture of secrecy.\nLine 14, 19:01:38: Current company: Mr. Anderson confirms receiving additional diversity and inclusion training at his\nLine 15, 19:01:38: current company. He emphasizes the positive aspects of his new work environment, highlighting open\nLine 16, 19:01:38: communication, valuing diverse perspectives, and equal opportunities, contrasting it with his experience\nLine 17, 19:01:38: at Acme.\nLine 18, 19:01:38: Follow-up: Both parties agree to a follow-up session. Mr. Thompson clarifies his intention to request the\nLine 19, 19:01:38: design materials and potentially contact other colleagues. Ms. Garcia objects to the witness's\nLine 20, 19:01:38: interpretation of his supervisor's tone, leading Mr. Thompson to rephrase the question, to which Mr.\nLine 21, 19:01:38: Anderson reiterates feeling discouraged and unheard, fearing his concerns wouldn't be taken seriously\nLine 22, 19:01:38: and could hinder his career.\nLine 23, 19:01:38: Deposition\nLine 24, 19:01:38: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Thompson, I believe we've covered the essential topics for today. However, as these are\nLine 25, 19:01:38: complex claims, I would appreciate the opportunity to review the transcript and potentially ask further\nLine 26, 19:01:38: questions at a future session, should any need arise.\nLine 27, 19:01:38: Mr. Thompson: No objection. Mr. Anderson, as Ms. Garcia mentioned, we appreciate your willingness to\nLine 28, 19:01:38: cooperate and provide additional materials. We will be in touch to schedule a follow-up session if\nLine 29, 19:01:38: needed.\nLine 30, 19:01:38: Witness: Understood.\nLine 31, 19:01:38: Summary\nLine 32, 19:01:38: The deposition concludes with Ms. Garcia expressing a desire to review the transcript and potentially\nLine 33, 19:01:38: ask further questions in a future session if needed. Mr. Thompson agrees, and both thank Mr. Anderson\nLine 34, 19:01:38: for his cooperation and willingness to provide additional materials. Mr. Anderson acknowledges their\nLine 35, 19:01:38: communication and awaits further information regarding a potential follow-up session.\n--- End of Page 9 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 10 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:38: Deposition\nLine 2, 19:01:38: MILLER: A driver is obligated to pay attention to the road and yield to other drivers when required. Let\nLine 3, 19:01:38: me take you back to what happened on April 20th, 2022. The Defendant, who was an attorney for the\nLine 4, 19:01:38: IRS, was driving her usual route to work. She drove down Annapolis Road to take a left onto another\nLine 5, 19:01:38: road.\nLine 6, 19:01:38: (Could we have the next slide, please?) She was driving down this road\u2026 can everyone see this? She\nLine 7, 19:01:38: stopped at a light on a clear day. While stopped, she reached down to find her parking pass.\nLine 8, 19:01:38: DEFENSE LAWYER: May we approach?\nLine 9, 19:01:38: THE COURT: Yes.\nLine 10, 19:01:38: BENCH CONFERENCE\nLine 11, 19:01:38: (Bench Conference begins \u2013 10:26:39m.)\nLine 12, 19:01:38: (The parties approach the bench for a discussion.)\nLine 13, 19:01:38: THE COURT: By court ruling, liability has been established. The focus of this case is only on damages. I\nLine 14, 19:01:38: understand why we\u2019re discussing these details, but it\u2019s about damages.\nLine 15, 19:01:38: MILLER: I\u2019m setting the scene for the accident because her damages are part of the accident narrative.\nLine 16, 19:01:38: DEFENSE LAWYER: We\u2019re only discussing the fact that an accident happened and a person was injured.\nLine 17, 19:01:38: The details about reaching and negligence seem to be evidence of liability.\nLine 18, 19:01:38: THE COURT: I understand. It\u2019s your opening statement, so I\u2019ll give you some leeway.\nLine 19, 19:01:38: MILLER: I\u2019m just providing context. I\u2019ll be getting into the damages soon.\nLine 20, 19:01:38: THE COURT: Alright.\nLine 21, 19:01:38: (Bench Conference concluded \u2013 10:27:32 m.)\nLine 22, 19:01:38: (The parties return to their places.)\nLine 23, 19:01:38: MILLER: The Defendant heard a horn beep and took a left turn. She didn\u2019t see the Plaintiff, who had the\nLine 24, 19:01:38: right of way, coming from the opposite direction. Due to the collision, the Plaintiff\u2019s ankle was broken\nLine 25, 19:01:38: and required surgery.\nLine 26, 19:01:38: Take a look at these images. The first one shows her ankle before surgery, the second one after surgery.\nLine 27, 19:01:38: Today, she still has 15 screws and three plates in her ankle. She will never be able to run again and\nLine 28, 19:01:38: standing for extended periods of time is difficult.\nLine 29, 19:01:38: We\u2019ve brought this case before you because of the harm caused to the Plaintiff. We needed to agree\nLine 30, 19:01:38: that the Defendant was at fault for the accident, which she has accepted. We also had to understand the\nLine 31, 19:01:38: extent and implications of the Plaintiff\u2019s damages, not just the initial injury and surgery, but also its long-\nLine 32, 19:01:38: term impact on her life.\nLine 33, 19:01:38: To do this, we spoke to her doctors, her husband, her friends, and even her employer. One of her\nLine 34, 19:01:38: doctors is going to talk to you.\n--- End of Page 10 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 11 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:38: This is the guy to see if something awful like this is going to happen to your ankle. He received an Ivy\nLine 2, 19:01:38: League education and, at one point, was the chief of foot and ankle orthopedic injuries at Johns\nLine 3, 19:01:38: Hopkins. He consults for the Baltimore Orioles. His resume, I want to say, is as long as your arm, but it\u2019s\nLine 4, 19:01:38: actually a lot longer than that.\nLine 5, 19:01:38: We\u2019re going to bring him to talk to you guys, in a very 2023 way. It\u2019s going to be by videotape, so his\nLine 6, 19:01:38: testimony will be by videotape, but it holds the same force as if it was at trial, and he came here to see\nLine 7, 19:01:38: us. And, of course, my partner Laura Zois and the defense attorney had an opportunity to ask him\nLine 8, 19:01:38: questions.\nLine 9, 19:01:38: He\u2019s going to tell you she still has 15 screws and three plates in her ankle holding everything together.\nLine 10, 19:01:38: The problem with that is that it creates a breeding ground for arthritis, and this 33-year-old woman\nLine 11, 19:01:38: already has the signs of arthritis. At some point, she\u2019s going to need what\u2019s called a fusion, which will\nLine 12, 19:01:38: stabilize her ankle. The bad news is, you can\u2019t move it once it locks, so you no longer have the ability to\nLine 13, 19:01:38: bend.\nLine 14, 19:01:38: This trial is about the harms and losses that she has suffered and endured as the result of this accident.\nLine 15, 19:01:38: This is not a case about sympathy. You should not award her damages because you feel sorry for her.\nLine 16, 19:01:38: You\u2019re going to hear about how the accident has impacted her professional and personal life.\nLine 17, 19:01:38: At the time of the crash, they were a very young family. They were an energetic family. This is an active\nLine 18, 19:01:38: family with four kids doing everything you can imagine, Six Flags, the park. They would run together.\nLine 19, 19:01:38: They played basketball together. They traveled everywhere, New York, Baltimore, Washington, DC. They\nLine 20, 19:01:38: were just a very active family.\nLine 21, 19:01:38: And she also had a vibrant social life. She was a hairstylist, and she loved that job. It was her social outlet\nLine 22, 19:01:38: beside her kids. She would do the church choir every Wednesday, and still found times to go out and see\nLine 23, 19:01:38: her family. She\u2019s still fighting with her family, but it\u2019s hard.\nLine 24, 19:01:38: She can\u2019t work as a hairstylist anymore. So what did she do? She went back to school to the University\nLine 25, 19:01:38: of Maryland. She\u2019s working, getting very close to getting her degree. She\u2019s still fighting. She has four kids\nLine 26, 19:01:38: they\u2019re chasing around.\nLine 27, 19:01:38: Let\u2019s go back and talk about how it ended up. Let\u2019s talk about the accident. She had this awful crash and\nLine 28, 19:01:38: needed emergency surgery where they put in these screws. She had a nine-month-old baby, along with\nLine 29, 19:01:38: three other kids. She and the two girls, the younger ones, went to live with her mom. Her mom took\nLine 30, 19:01:38: care of her and the girls, while her husband took care of the other kids.\nLine 31, 19:01:38: This has been a massive disruption to their lives. The accident has completely changed her life, and it\u2019s\nLine 32, 19:01:38: reflected in every facet of her day-to-day. Her job, her family life, her hobbies, everything she used to\nLine 33, 19:01:38: take pleasure in has been impacted in one way or another. And the evidence in this case will show these\nLine 34, 19:01:38: changes are likely to persist for the rest of her life.\nLine 35, 19:01:38: We ask you to consider the totality of these changes, the persistent harm and loss she\u2019s suffered and\nLine 36, 19:01:38: will continue to suffer, as a direct result of the accident. We ask you to consider these when coming to a\nLine 37, 19:01:38: decision in this case.\n--- End of Page 11 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 12 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:38: This accident, however, led to an upheaval in their lives. About a month after the accident, she managed\nLine 2, 19:01:38: to return home with the kids. Her mother, an FDA employee, took three months off work to care for her,\nLine 3, 19:01:38: her daughter, and her grandchildren. The accident wreaked havoc on their lives.\nLine 4, 19:01:38: She endured six months of rigorous physical therapy and another operation. While it was painful and\nLine 5, 19:01:38: difficult, the effort was worthwhile as it improved her condition, especially her ankle, though we wish\nLine 6, 19:01:38: she had recovered more.\nLine 7, 19:01:38: As we delve into this case, it\u2019s about the harm and losses experienced. We will ask you to make amends\nLine 8, 19:01:38: where possible and provide compensation for the irreparable harm. The damages can be categorized\nLine 9, 19:01:38: into three parts: her medical bills, the post-accident trauma suffered by her and her family, and the pain\nLine 10, 19:01:38: she will endure for the expected next 45 years of her life.\nLine 11, 19:01:38: She was a spontaneous person, fond of making impromptu plans like going to Virginia Beach over the\nLine 12, 19:01:38: weekend or heading to the park. Now, every activity revolves around her ability to reach there, her\nLine 13, 19:01:38: mobility, and whether she can tolerate the pain during the trip. This situation has affected her and her\nLine 14, 19:01:38: four kids, as well as her husband.\nLine 15, 19:01:38: The court wants to clarify that the evidence and testimonies from the witness stand are what will\nLine 16, 19:01:38: control your deliberations. Opening statements and closing arguments of lawyers do not constitute\nLine 17, 19:01:38: evidence.\nLine 18, 19:01:38: This case is not just about the suffering of their children or her husband. It\u2019s about the impact of their\nLine 19, 19:01:38: suffering on her. We will ask you to consider an amount that may seem high at the beginning. But we\nLine 20, 19:01:38: believe that after hearing all the evidence, you\u2019ll find it to be a fair compensation for her losses and\nLine 21, 19:01:38: harm. The amount we suggest is $1.1 million.\nLine 22, 19:01:38: Defense Opening Statement\nLine 23, 19:01:38: Regarding the defendant, they acknowledge the responsibility for the accident and that it was their\nLine 24, 19:01:38: fault. The case is for you to determine the appropriate damages. The injury is severe, and they ask for an\nLine 25, 19:01:38: extraordinary amount of compensation.\nLine 26, 19:01:38: She broke her ankle, which was repaired surgically with plates and screws. There was a second surgery\nLine 27, 19:01:38: due to loosening of the screws, which were then removed. She attended physical therapy, which\nLine 28, 19:01:38: improved her ability to move her ankle. Whether she will need surgery in the future is uncertain.\nLine 29, 19:01:38: The past medical expenses are around $36,505, which we don\u2019t contest. Her lost wages due to the\nLine 30, 19:01:38: accident are around $3,400 to $3,500. These are not the focal points of this case. The main issue is the\nLine 31, 19:01:38: amount to be awarded for non-economic damages, for which we request something fair, reasonable,\nLine 32, 19:01:38: and sensible.\nLine 33, 19:01:38: Thank you for your time and attention, and we hope to conclude this case promptly.\nLine 34, 19:01:38: Testimony of Victim\u2019s Husband\nLine 35, 19:01:38: Mr. Miller: Good morning. Can I have your address?\nLine 36, 19:01:38: SJ: Certainly.\nLine 37, 19:01:38: Mr. Miller: How long have you lived at that address?\n--- End of Page 12 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 13 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: SJ: I bought the house in 2003, so it\u2019s been approximately ten years.\nLine 2, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Who lives there with you?\nLine 3, 19:01:39: SJ: My wife, and our four children.\nLine 4, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Can you tell the jury how old your children are and their names?\nLine 5, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes. My children are 13, and the others are\u2026\nLine 6, 19:01:39: The Honorable Judge: Please continue.\nLine 7, 19:01:39: SJ: \u2026five, and three.\nLine 8, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: I understand. And for some background, what do you do for a living?\nLine 9, 19:01:39: SJ: I\u2019m currently the general manager at Oreck Clean Home Center.\nLine 10, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: And where are these locations?\nLine 11, 19:01:39: SJ: We have six locations in Maryland and Virginia.\nLine 12, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: What are your responsibilities at work?\nLine 13, 19:01:39: SJ: I oversee all six stores and manage one of them.\nLine 14, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Can you describe your work schedule?\nLine 15, 19:01:39: SJ: I work Monday through Saturday, from 10:00 am to 7:00 pm. Often, I work seven days a week which\nLine 16, 19:01:39: means working on Sundays from 12:00 pm to 5:00 pm.\nLine 17, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: How do you feel about those hours?\nLine 18, 19:01:39: SJ: They are long, but I need to work to support my family.\nLine 19, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: How long have you known your wife?\nLine 20, 19:01:39: SJ: I met her in 1993, she was my sister\u2019s best friend.\nLine 21, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: You mean your wife was your sister\u2019s best friend?\nLine 22, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes, I apologize for the confusion. She was indeed my sister\u2019s best friend.\nLine 23, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Let\u2019s move to another topic. Do you remember the car accident your wife was in 2022?\nLine 24, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes, I do.\nLine 25, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Prior to the accident, can you describe your household?\nLine 26, 19:01:39: SJ: Our household was what I would consider the perfect life. My wife and children were happy and\nLine 27, 19:01:39: always engaged in activities. We used to take vacations and attend family reunions.\nLine 28, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Was your wife a spontaneous person or a planner?\nLine 29, 19:01:39: SJ: She was more spontaneous, always ready to take on new activities.\n--- End of Page 13 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 14 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Could you describe her for the jury?\nLine 2, 19:01:39: SJ: She is always happy, loves socializing and helping people. She attended choir rehearsal, Bible study\nLine 3, 19:01:39: every week, and also took care of our four children.\nLine 4, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: What was her job at the time of the crash?\nLine 5, 19:01:39: SJ: She was the assistant manager of a hair salon.\nLine 6, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Did she enjoy her work?\nLine 7, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes, she loved her work. It was part of her identity.\nLine 8, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Did your wife\u2019s demeanor change after the car accident?\nLine 9, 19:01:39: SJ: Yes, after the accident everything changed. Our family life and activity level changed significantly. She\nLine 10, 19:01:39: used to take the children to sporting events and practice basketball. Now, she can\u2019t do these activities.\nLine 11, 19:01:39: She no longer goes on family vacations. My two older sons call her \u201cboring\u201d now because of her reduced\nLine 12, 19:01:39: activity level. The accident has restricted her capabilities and as a result, she can\u2019t even do simple tasks\nLine 13, 19:01:39: like carrying laundry baskets or standing up to cook. Our family life has changed drastically since the\nLine 14, 19:01:39: accident.\nLine 15, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Has your wife gone back to work since the accident?\nLine 16, 19:01:39: SJ: She tried to help a friend out a couple of months ago at her hair salon, but it ended with her in a lot\nLine 17, 19:01:39: of pain due to the swelling in her ankle.\nLine 18, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: I have here a picture you received from your wife. Is this the picture she sent you?\nLine 19, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Can you tell us how your wife\u2019s personal social life has been affected since the crash?\nLine 20, 19:01:39: SJ: Her social life has indeed changed significantly. Before the accident, she would regularly go out with\nLine 21, 19:01:39: friends, engage in dancing, and other social activities. However, the constant pain and discomfort after\nLine 22, 19:01:39: the crash have made such activities impossible. Her social life is definitely not the same as before.\nLine 23, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: You mentioned earlier about her job. Was she able to resume work post the crash?\nLine 24, 19:01:39: SJ: She attempted to return to work, but the persistent pain made it unmanageable, particularly the\nLine 25, 19:01:39: long-standing hours. Eventually, she was forced to leave her job.\nLine 26, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: How has this situation impacted your family\u2019s finances?\nLine 27, 19:01:39: SJ: The impact has been substantial. She held the position of an assistant manager at a hair salon,\nLine 28, 19:01:39: bringing in a significant income. Now, with my single income, managing expenses for our four children\nLine 29, 19:01:39: and her medical bills has been strenuous.\nLine 30, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Besides the financial struggle, can you share how your relationship with your wife has\nLine 31, 19:01:39: evolved post the accident?\nLine 32, 19:01:39: SJ: Our relationship has undeniably been affected. She isn\u2019t the same person she was before the crash.\nLine 33, 19:01:39: Her constant pain and fatigue, coupled with frustration, have been hard on both of us.\nLine 34, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: And your children? How have they been coping with all these changes?\n--- End of Page 14 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 15 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: SJ: Our children have had to make significant adjustments. They miss the mother they had before the\nLine 2, 19:01:39: crash, not understanding why she can\u2019t engage in the activities she used to do with them. My older\nLine 3, 19:01:39: sons, in particular, have had to step up, assisting more with household chores. It\u2019s been a lot for them\nLine 4, 19:01:39: too.\nLine 5, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: Finally, could you share your hopes for your wife\u2019s future?\nLine 6, 19:01:39: SJ: My biggest hope is for her to find relief from her pain and regain some semblance of normalcy. She\nLine 7, 19:01:39: deserves to live her life, not just endure it. It\u2019s challenging to see such a wonderful person go through\nLine 8, 19:01:39: this. We are taking each day as it comes, hoping for a better future.\nLine 9, 19:01:39: Defense Attorney Cross Examination of Victim\u2019s Husband\nLine 10, 19:01:39: Q: Regarding the foot stretching exercises, you assist her with those?\nLine 11, 19:01:39: A: Yes, I do.\nLine 12, 19:01:39: Q: Looking through her medical records, I noticed there\u2019s mention of an exercise bike at home. Do you\nLine 13, 19:01:39: have one?\nLine 14, 19:01:39: A: Indeed, we do have an exercise bike at home.\nLine 15, 19:01:39: Q: Did she frequently use the exercise bike, especially post-accident?\nLine 16, 19:01:39: A: Initially, during her therapy, they had her try riding the exercise bike.\nLine 17, 19:01:39: Q: Can you tell us what kind of exercises she did at home after the accident?\nLine 18, 19:01:39: A: She was given a chart with exercises, and I\u2019ve been helping her to flex her foot in both directions to\nLine 19, 19:01:39: try and loosen it up.\nLine 20, 19:01:39: Q: How long did this routine last?\nLine 21, 19:01:39: A: Actually, I still assist her with the foot exercises every night.\nLine 22, 19:01:39: Q: So you assist her based on the instructions from the chart?\nLine 23, 19:01:39: A: Not directly from the chart, but I\u2019ve learned the correct angles and try to flex her foot every night for\nLine 24, 19:01:39: her comfort and to aid her sleep.\nLine 25, 19:01:39: Q: Does she drive?\nLine 26, 19:01:39: A: Yes, she does.\nLine 27, 19:01:39: Q: Prior to the accident, she was employed full time?\nLine 28, 19:01:39: A: Yes, that\u2019s correct.\nLine 29, 19:01:39: Q: The jury was informed initially that she was also pursuing a degree?\nLine 30, 19:01:39: A: Yes, she was attending the University of Maryland.\nLine 31, 19:01:39: Q: Did she commute to the university?\nLine 32, 19:01:39: A: At certain points she did, but due to our four children, she primarily takes her classes online now.\n--- End of Page 15 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 16 ---\nLine 1, 19:01:39: Q: How close is she to obtaining her degree?\nLine 2, 19:01:39: A: She\u2019s expected to graduate within the next year.\nLine 3, 19:01:39: Court: Any redirect?\nLine 4, 19:01:39: Mr. Miller: No further questions, Your Honor.\nLine 5, 19:01:39: Court: Thank you, sir, you may step down.

There was some damage done\nLine 10, 19:01:09: to the motor of the car, I think, because I had to\nLine 11, 19:01:09: take it back to Thompson Dodge because it was doing\nLine 12, 19:01:09: so much rattling, and they had to do something to\nLine 13, 19:01:09: the steering.\nLine 14, 19:01:09: Q. Okay.

So in other words, trying to perceive what\nLine 11, 19:01:13: happened, it wasn't like the truck was sort of\nLine 12, 19:01:13: sliding over to the right?\nLine 13, 19:01:13: A.

I mean, I was holding onto\nLine 7, 19:01:13: the steering wheel, and I don't know what happened.\nLine 8, 19:01:13: I mean, it just, the impact, because I mean, he just\nLine 9, 19:01:13: came in over my, just came in front of me, and it\nLine 10, 19:01:13: was like boom. There was no stopping. There was\nLine 11, 19:01:13: nowhere I could just, just slam on the brakes or\nLine 12, 19:01:13: anything. There was no -- it was there.

What did you have done at Johns Hopkins on\nLine 20, 19:01:23: December 7th? '\nLine 21, 19:01:23: A. It's called a stellate, S-T-E-L-L-A-G-E,\nLine 22, 19:01:23: ganglion, G-A-L-L-I-O-N, blockage.

And what's the purpose of that?\nLine 7, 19:01:23: A. It deadens the nerves, because what\nLine 8, 19:01:23: happens is when you have severe nerve damage, it's\nLine 9, 19:01:23: like electrical impulses going off. It's like\nLine 10, 19:01:23: taking a cord and fraying it and all the electrical ;\nLine 11, 19:01:23: impulses going all over the place. That's what\nLine 12, 19:01:23: causes the pain in the tissues, so what they do is :\nLine 13, 19:01:23: they block it off so it doesn't go down that far.\nLine 14, 19:01:23: It just leaves an even line. |\nLine 15, 19:01:23: Q.

No, he did not.\nLine 13, 19:01:05: Okay. What did the truck do next?\nLine 14, 19:01:05: A. He just basically had gotten into that\nLine 15, 19:01:05: lane when I moved over. He had gotten into that\nLine 16, 19:01:05: lane, and I moved over into my lane.\nLine 17, 19:01:05: Q. Okay.

I'm just estimating, because I had went in\nLine 13, 19:01:23: for Qa, \u00abGUERIN nad wanted me to see a\nLine 14, 19:01:23: all> who specializes in pain management so\nLine 15, 19:01:23: they could do some ganglion stellate blockages to :\nLine 16, 19:01:23: stop the nerve endings from the pain that they were |\nLine 17, 19:01:23: causing, and I had that done at Johns Hopkins on\nLine 18, 19:01:23: December 7th.\nLine 19, 19:01:23: Q. What did you have done at Johns Hopkins on\nLine 20, 19:01:23: December 7th? '\nLine 21, 19:01:23: A. It's called a stellate, S-T-E-L-L-A-G-E,\nLine 22, 19:01:23: ganglion, G-A-L-L-I-O-N, blockage.

And what's the purpose of that?\nLine 7, 19:01:23: A. It deadens the nerves, because what\nLine 8, 19:01:23: happens is when you have severe nerve damage, it's\nLine 9, 19:01:23: like electrical impulses going off. It's like\nLine 10, 19:01:23: taking a cord and fraying it and all the electrical ;\nLine 11, 19:01:23: impulses going all over the place. That's what\nLine 12, 19:01:23: causes the pain in the tissues, so what they do is :\nLine 13, 19:01:23: they block it off so it doesn't go down that far.\nLine 14, 19:01:23: It just leaves an even line. |\nLine 15, 19:01:23: Q.

No, he did not.\nLine 13, 19:01:05: Okay. What did the truck do next?\nLine 14, 19:01:05: A. He just basically had gotten into that\nLine 15, 19:01:05: lane when I moved over. He had gotten into that\nLine 16, 19:01:05: lane, and I moved over into my lane.\nLine 17, 19:01:05: Q. Okay. Were you and the truck going\nLine 18, 19:01:05: approximately the same speed, or is one of you going\nLine 19, 19:01:05: faster than the other?\nLine 20, 19:01:05: A. Probably exactly the same, because we were\nLine 21, 19:01:05: staying up at the same pace all the way down.\nLine 22, 19:01:05: Q. And what speed was that?\nLine 23, 19:01:05: A.

There was some damage done\nLine 10, 19:01:09: to the motor of the car, I think, because I had to\nLine 11, 19:01:09: take it back to Thompson Dodge because it was doing\nLine 12, 19:01:09: so much rattling, and they had to do something to\nLine 13, 19:01:09: the steering.\nLine 14, 19:01:09: Q. Okay.

On the right side, the lane is a real\nLine 6, 19:01:09: small lane. I mean, that tractor trailer was big.\nLine 7, 19:01:09: If I would have seen him turn or even be in the\nLine 8, 19:01:09: middle of any of the lanes, I would have seen that\nLine 9, 19:01:09: compared to my truck, I would have seen him pull\nLine 10, 19:01:09: away from my truck.

And the front of the tractor had :\nLine 8, 19:01:13: turned close to 90 degrees towards your truck?\nLine 9, 19:01:13: A. Correct.\nLine 10, 19:01:13: Q. So in other words, trying to perceive what\nLine 11, 19:01:13: happened, it wasn't like the truck was sort of\nLine 12, 19:01:13: sliding over to the right?\nLine 13, 19:01:13: A.

I mean, I was holding onto\nLine 7, 19:01:13: the steering wheel, and I don't know what happened.\nLine 8, 19:01:13: I mean, it just, the impact, because I mean, he just\nLine 9, 19:01:13: came in over my, just came in front of me, and it\nLine 10, 19:01:13: was like boom. There was no stopping. There was\nLine 11, 19:01:13: nowhere I could just, just slam on the brakes or\nLine 12, 19:01:13: anything. There was no -- it was there.

I'm just estimating, because I had went in\nLine 13, 19:01:23: for Qa, \u00abGUERIN nad wanted me to see a\nLine 14, 19:01:23: all> who specializes in pain management so\nLine 15, 19:01:23: they could do some ganglion stellate blockages to :\nLine 16, 19:01:23: stop the nerve endings from the pain that they were |\nLine 17, 19:01:23: causing, and I had that done at Johns Hopkins on\nLine 18, 19:01:23: December 7th.\nLine 19, 19:01:23: Q. What did you have done at Johns Hopkins on\nLine 20, 19:01:23: December 7th? '\nLine 21, 19:01:23: A. It's called a stellate, S-T-E-L-L-A-G-E,\nLine 22, 19:01:23: ganglion, G-A-L-L-I-O-N, blockage.

And what's the purpose of that?\nLine 7, 19:01:23: A. It deadens the nerves, because what\nLine 8, 19:01:23: happens is when you have severe nerve damage, it's\nLine 9, 19:01:23: like electrical impulses going off. It's like\nLine 10, 19:01:23: taking a cord and fraying it and all the electrical ;\nLine 11, 19:01:23: impulses going all over the place. That's what\nLine 12, 19:01:23: causes the pain in the tissues, so what they do is :\nLine 13, 19:01:23: they block it off so it doesn't go down that far.\nLine 14, 19:01:23: It just leaves an even line. |\nLine 15, 19:01:23: Q.

Yes, it does.\nLine 12, 19:01:02: Q. -- or on the lefthand side? The right?\nLine 13, 19:01:02: A. The right side, right. That's what I\nLine 14, 19:01:02: Meant coming over.\nLine 15, 19:01:02: Q. Okay. So when the right lane is created,\nLine 16, 19:01:02: did I understand that you moved over one lane to the\nLine 17, 19:01:02: right?\nLine 18, 19:01:02: A. Yes, I did.\nLine 19, 19:01:02: QO. And the truck moved over one lane so it's\nLine 20, 19:01:02: in the second lane from the right?\nLine 21, 19:01:02: A. Correct.\nLine 22, 19:01:02: Q. Okay.

The back side of his door, of the tractor\nLine 18, 19:01:05: trailer, because I remember looking over. We\nLine 19, 19:01:05: weren't going fast at all. I remember looking over f[\nLine 20, 19:01:05: and seeing the numbers that was on the side of the i\nLine 21, 19:01:05: door because I felt -- I never seen a truck that big |\nLine 22, 19:01:05: with -- it hardly had, didn't have a very big load :\nLine 23, 19:01:05: on it.

And then what did you do? Did you move q\nLine 5, 19:01:05: into the right lane?\nLine 6, 19:01:05: A. Yes. I put my blinker on and I moved into\nLine 7, 19:01:05: the right lane because that exit, that lane takes me\nLine 8, 19:01:05: to my exit.\nLine 9, 19:01:05: Q. Okay.

No, he did not.\nLine 13, 19:01:05: Okay. What did the truck do next?\nLine 14, 19:01:05: A. He just basically had gotten into that\nLine 15, 19:01:05: lane when I moved over. He had gotten into that\nLine 16, 19:01:05: lane, and I moved over into my lane.\nLine 17, 19:01:05: Q. Okay.

Is there any other damage you can see in |\nLine 8, 19:01:09: the pictures that you could point out to me? :\nLine 9, 19:01:09: A. No, that's it. There was some damage done\nLine 10, 19:01:09: to the motor of the car, I think, because I had to\nLine 11, 19:01:09: take it back to Thompson Dodge because it was doing\nLine 12, 19:01:09: so much rattling, and they had to do something to\nLine 13, 19:01:09: the steering.\nLine 14, 19:01:09: Q. Okay.

There was no stopping. There was\nLine 11, 19:01:13: nowhere I could just, just slam on the brakes or\nLine 12, 19:01:13: anything. There was no -- it was there.

And what's the purpose of that?\nLine 7, 19:01:23: A. It deadens the nerves, because what\nLine 8, 19:01:23: happens is when you have severe nerve damage, it's\nLine 9, 19:01:23: like electrical impulses going off. It's like\nLine 10, 19:01:23: taking a cord and fraying it and all the electrical ;\nLine 11, 19:01:23: impulses going all over the place.
