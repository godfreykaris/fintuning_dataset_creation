Is there any other damage you can see in |\nLine 590, 16:05:41: the pictures that you could point out to me? :\nLine 591, 16:05:41: A. No, that's it. There was some damage done\nLine 592, 16:05:41: to the motor of the car, I think, because I had to\nLine 593, 16:05:41: take it back to Thompson Dodge because it was doing\nLine 594, 16:05:41: so much rattling, and they had to do something to\nLine 595, 16:05:41: the steering.\nLine 596, 16:05:41: Q. Okay. So the two of you were going\nLine 597, 16:05:41: alongside of each other on North Point for a period\nLine 598, 16:05:41: of time at about the same speed, and did you ever\nLine 599, 16:05:41: see a turn signal on the truck?\nLine 600, 16:05:41: A. No, sir, I did not.\nLine 601, 16:05:41: Q. Can you describe to me the angle of the\nLine 602, 16:05:41: tractor when it hit you? Do you know what I mean?\nLine 603, 16:05:41: Was it sort of side to side or the tractor turned\nLine 604, 16:05:41: 90 degrees?\nLine 605, 16:05:41: A. He didn't turn because I figured I\nLine 606, 16:05:41: probably would have seen if he would have went out\nLine 607, 16:05:41: Corbin Hook, Reporting s[ Videoconferencing\nLine 608, 16:05:41: (410) 268-6006 1-866-337-6778\n--- End of Page 23 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 24 ---\nLine 609, 16:05:41: Deposition o\nLine 610, 16:05:41: Taken on June 26, 2006\nLine 611, 16:05:41: Page 24 |\nLine 612, 16:05:41: of the lines, because I mean, the road is very small }\nLine 613, 16:05:41: on that side.

And what's the purpose of that?\nLine 976, 16:06:00: A. It deadens the nerves, because what\nLine 977, 16:06:00: happens is when you have severe nerve damage, it's\nLine 978, 16:06:00: like electrical impulses going off. It's like\nLine 979, 16:06:00: taking a cord and fraying it and all the electrical ;\nLine 980, 16:06:00: impulses going all over the place. That's what\nLine 981, 16:06:00: causes the pain in the tissues, so what they do is :\nLine 982, 16:06:00: they block it off so it doesn't go down that far.\nLine 983, 16:06:00: It just leaves an even line. |\nLine 984, 16:06:00: Q.

There was some damage done\nLine 592, 16:05:41: to the motor of the car, I think, because I had to\nLine 593, 16:05:41: take it back to Thompson Dodge because it was doing\nLine 594, 16:05:41: so much rattling, and they had to do something to\nLine 595, 16:05:41: the steering.\nLine 596, 16:05:41: Q.
