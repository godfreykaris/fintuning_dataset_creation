There was some damage done\nLine 592, 16:04:41: to the motor of the car, I think, because I had to\nLine 593, 16:04:41: take it back to Thompson Dodge because it was doing\nLine 594, 16:04:41: so much rattling, and they had to do something to\nLine 595, 16:04:41: the steering.\nLine 596, 16:04:41: Q. Okay. So the two of you were going\nLine 597, 16:04:41: alongside of each other on North Point for a period\nLine 598, 16:04:41: of time at about the same speed, and did you ever\nLine 599, 16:04:41: see a turn signal on the truck?\nLine 600, 16:04:41: A.

There was some damage done\nLine 592, 16:04:41: to the motor of the car, I think, because I had to\nLine 593, 16:04:41: take it back to Thompson Dodge because it was doing\nLine 594, 16:04:41: so much rattling, and they had to do something to\nLine 595, 16:04:41: the steering.\nLine 596, 16:04:41: Q.

There was some damage done\nLine 592, 16:05:41: to the motor of the car, I think, because I had to\nLine 593, 16:05:41: take it back to Thompson Dodge because it was doing\nLine 594, 16:05:41: so much rattling, and they had to do something to\nLine 595, 16:05:41: the steering.\nLine 596, 16:05:41: Q.

Yes, it does, because his whole trailer\nLine 639, 16:05:48: was in his lane, and that lane, it was not over in\nLine 640, 16:05:48: any of the lanes.\nLine 641, 16:05:48: Q. Okay.

I mean, I was holding onto\nLine 667, 16:05:48: the steering wheel, and I don't know what happened.\nLine 668, 16:05:48: I mean, it just, the impact, because I mean, he just\nLine 669, 16:05:48: came in over my, just came in front of me, and it\nLine 670, 16:05:48: was like boom.

And what's the purpose of that?\nLine 976, 16:06:00: A. It deadens the nerves, because what\nLine 977, 16:06:00: happens is when you have severe nerve damage, it's\nLine 978, 16:06:00: like electrical impulses going off. It's like\nLine 979, 16:06:00: taking a cord and fraying it and all the electrical ;\nLine 980, 16:06:00: impulses going all over the place. That's what\nLine 981, 16:06:00: causes the pain in the tissues, so what they do is :\nLine 982, 16:06:00: they block it off so it doesn't go down that far.\nLine 983, 16:06:00: It just leaves an even line. |\nLine 984, 16:06:00: Q.

There was some damage done\nLine 592, 16:05:41: to the motor of the car, I think, because I had to\nLine 593, 16:05:41: take it back to Thompson Dodge because it was doing\nLine 594, 16:05:41: so much rattling, and they had to do something to\nLine 595, 16:05:41: the steering.\nLine 596, 16:05:41: Q. Okay. So the two of you were going\nLine 597, 16:05:41: alongside of each other on North Point for a period\nLine 598, 16:05:41: of time at about the same speed, and did you ever\nLine 599, 16:05:41: see a turn signal on the truck?\nLine 600, 16:05:41: A. No, sir, I did not.\nLine 601, 16:05:41: Q. Can you describe to me the angle of the\nLine 602, 16:05:41: tractor when it hit you? Do you know what I mean?\nLine 603, 16:05:41: Was it sort of side to side or the tractor turned\nLine 604, 16:05:41: 90 degrees?\nLine 605, 16:05:41: A. He didn't turn because I figured I\nLine 606, 16:05:41: probably would have seen if he would have went out\nLine 607, 16:05:41: Corbin Hook, Reporting s[ Videoconferencing\nLine 608, 16:05:41: (410) 268-6006 1-866-337-6778\n--- End of Page 23 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 24 ---\nLine 609, 16:05:41: Deposition o\nLine 610, 16:05:41: Taken on June 26, 2006\nLine 611, 16:05:41: Page 24 |\nLine 612, 16:05:41: of the lines, because I mean, the road is very small }\nLine 613, 16:05:41: on that side.

And what's the purpose of that?\nLine 976, 16:06:00: A. It deadens the nerves, because what\nLine 977, 16:06:00: happens is when you have severe nerve damage, it's\nLine 978, 16:06:00: like electrical impulses going off. It's like\nLine 979, 16:06:00: taking a cord and fraying it and all the electrical ;\nLine 980, 16:06:00: impulses going all over the place. That's what\nLine 981, 16:06:00: causes the pain in the tissues, so what they do is :\nLine 982, 16:06:00: they block it off so it doesn't go down that far.\nLine 983, 16:06:00: It just leaves an even line. |\nLine 984, 16:06:00: Q.

During meetings, colleagues often\nLine 49, 16:07:13: talked over me or dismissed my ideas, particularly when compared to my younger male colleagues. I\nLine 50, 16:07:13: was also consistently passed over for promotions despite having experience and qualifications\nLine 51, 16:07:13: comparable to others who got promoted.\nLine 52, 16:07:13: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you be specific about which colleagues treated you this way and provide\nLine 53, 16:07:13: specific examples of situations where these incidents occurred?\nLine 54, 16:07:13: Witness: One specific example would be the marketing campaign for the new product launch in 2023. I\nLine 55, 16:07:13: put significant effort into developing design concepts, but they were ultimately disregarded without any\nLine 56, 16:07:13: explanation. My male colleague's design, which was very similar to mine, was ultimately chosen.\nLine 57, 16:07:13: Mr. Thompson: Did you ever report any of these incidents to your supervisor or anyone else at Acme?\nLine 58, 16:07:13: Witness: I once mentioned feeling undervalued to my supervisor, but they brushed it off, suggesting I\nLine 59, 16:07:13: needed to \"work harder to prove myself.\" I wasn't comfortable bringing it up further after that.\nLine 60, 16:07:13: Mr. Thompson: Did you decide to leave Acme voluntarily, or were you terminated?\nLine 61, 16:07:13: Witness: When they announced another promotion I felt qualified for, but was once again passed over\nLine 62, 16:07:13: without explanation, I decided it was time to find a new position where I felt valued and respected.\nLine 63, 16:07:13: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you confirm that your decision to leave Acme was solely based on not\nLine 64, 16:07:13: receiving the promotion, and not due to other factors like job performance or personal reasons?\nLine 65, 16:07:13: Witness: To the best of my knowledge, yes. It became clear to me that further advancement\nLine 66, 16:07:13: opportunities within the company were unlikely.\nLine 67, 16:07:13: Mr. Thompson: That's all my questions at this time.\nLine 68, 16:07:13: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, during your time at Acme, did you ever receive any negative performance\nLine 69, 16:07:13: reviews or warnings related to your work performance?\nLine 70, 16:07:13: Witness: No, as mentioned before, my performance reviews were always positive.\nLine 71, 16:07:13: Ms. Garcia: Did you ever attend any diversity and inclusion training offered by Acme during your\nLine 72, 16:07:13: employment?\nLine 73, 16:07:13: Witness: I did participate in the mandatory online training modules, but there weren't any specific\nLine 74, 16:07:13: training sessions related to addressing or reporting potentially discriminatory situations within the\nLine 75, 16:07:13: company.\nLine 76, 16:07:13: Summary\n--- End of Page 3 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 4 ---\nLine 77, 16:07:13: Michael Anderson details specific incidents supporting his feeling of being undervalued based on his\nLine 78, 16:07:13: protected category. He describes colleagues disregarding his ideas and being passed over for\nLine 79, 16:07:13: promotions despite comparable qualifications. He provides a specific example from the 2023 product\nLine 80, 16:07:13: launch where his design was overlooked in favor of a male colleague's similar work. He mentions\nLine 81, 16:07:13: mentioning his concerns to his supervisor but being discouraged from pursuing them. He clarifies his\nLine 82, 16:07:13: decision to leave Acme was due to the lack of advancement opportunities, not performance or personal\nLine 83, 16:07:13: reasons. Ms. Garcia then establishes that Mr. Anderson's performance was consistently good and that\nLine 84, 16:07:13: he participated in available diversity training while at Acme, though specific training for addressing\nLine 85, 16:07:13: potential discrimination was absent.\nLine 86, 16:07:13: Deposition:\nLine 87, 16:07:13: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, are you aware of Acme's anti-discrimination policy or how complaints of\nLine 88, 16:07:13: discrimination are addressed within the company?\nLine 89, 16:07:13: Witness: I reviewed the employee handbook, which did explain the existence of an anti-discrimination\nLine 90, 16:07:13: policy. However, I was unsure of the specific complaint process at the time\nLine 91, 16:07:13: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you elaborate on why you felt apprehensive about bringing up these\nLine 92, 16:07:13: incidents to your supervisor despite feeling uncomfortable and undervalued?\nLine 93, 16:07:13: Witness: Honestly, there were a few reasons. Firstly, as I mentioned, when I did hint at feeling\nLine 94, 16:07:13: undervalued to my supervisor, their dismissive response discouraged me from further discussions. It\nLine 95, 16:07:13: seemed like they weren't receptive to hearing about any potential issues.\nLine 96, 16:07:13: Secondly, there was a general company culture that made me hesitant to speak up. Younger male\nLine 97, 16:07:13: colleagues often dominated conversations and presentations, and there weren't many women in senior\nLine 98, 16:07:13: positions within the marketing department. It felt like my voice wouldn't be heard or even worse, that\nLine 99, 16:07:13: bringing forward complaints might lead to retaliation or hinder my career further.\nLine 100, 16:07:13: Ms. Garcia: Did you notice any specific instances of retaliation against other employees who may have\nLine 101, 16:07:13: raised complaints or concerns about work environment issues?\nLine 102, 16:07:13: Witness: While I can't say for sure, there was one colleague, Sarah Lopez, who openly challenged gender\nLine 103, 16:07:13: bias during a department meeting but was subsequently given less desirable project assignments\nLine 104, 16:07:13: compared to her male colleagues. This incident definitely reinforced my concerns about potentially\nLine 105, 16:07:13: facing a similar situation.**\nLine 106, 16:07:13: Mr. Thompson: Objection, speculation about an unrelated case is irrelevant to the present matter.\nLine 107, 16:07:13: Ms. Garcia: Withdrawn. Mr. Anderson, did you ever discuss your concerns about potential bias or lack of\nLine 108, 16:07:13: promotion opportunities with any human resources personnel at Acme?\nLine 109, 16:07:13: Witness: No, I didn't. As I mentioned before, the lack of clarity on the specific complaint process\nLine 110, 16:07:13: combined with the overall culture discouraged me from pursuing that route.\nLine 111, 16:07:13: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, since leaving Acme, have you sought employment elsewhere?\n--- End of Page 4 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 5 ---\nLine 112, 16:07:14: Witness: Yes, I am currently employed at a different company and feel much more valued and respected\nLine 113, 16:07:14: in my current role. The work environment is significantly more inclusive, and I regularly receive positive\nLine 114, 16:07:14: feedback and opportunities for professional development.\nLine 115, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, how has your experience at Acme impacted you personally and\nLine 116, 16:07:14: professionally?\nLine 117, 16:07:14: Witness: It was definitely a frustrating and discouraging experience. It felt like my hard work and\nLine 118, 16:07:14: qualifications weren't being recognized fairly, leading to some self-doubt and a sense of being\nLine 119, 16:07:14: undervalued. However, finding a new and positive work environment has helped me rebuild my\nLine 120, 16:07:14: confidence and refocus on my career goals.\nLine 121, 16:07:14: Ms. Garcia: I have no further questions.\nLine 122, 16:07:14: Summary\nLine 123, 16:07:14: This segment explores Mr. Anderson's reasons for not formally complaining despite feeling undervalued.\nLine 124, 16:07:14: He reiterates his supervisor's dismissive response and the perceived lack of receptiveness within the\nLine 125, 16:07:14: company culture. He describes a specific instance where a colleague who challenged gender bias faced\nLine 126, 16:07:14: negative consequences, reinforcing his fear of retaliation. He clarifies that he didn't pursue HR due to\nLine 127, 16:07:14: unclear procedures and the discouraging company culture. Finally, he highlights his positive experience\nLine 128, 16:07:14: at a new company, emphasizing feelings of value, inclusion, and professional growth in contrast to his\nLine 129, 16:07:14: experience at Acme. He concludes by acknowledging the frustration and self-doubt from Acme but also\nLine 130, 16:07:14: the positive impact of finding a supportive work environment.\nLine 131, 16:07:14: Deposition\nLine 132, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: I have one final question. Mr. Anderson, is there anything else you would like to add\nLine 133, 16:07:14: regarding your experience at Acme Corporation?\nLine 134, 16:07:14: Witness: Just that I hope by sharing my story, it can contribute to fostering a more diverse and inclusive\nLine 135, 16:07:14: work environment at Acme for future employees. Everyone deserves to feel valued and respected in\nLine 136, 16:07:14: their workplace, regardless of their [protected category].\nLine 137, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Interesting point, Mr. Anderson. Ms. Garcia, while you have no further questions, I'd like\nLine 138, 16:07:14: to explore some aspects of Mr. Anderson's experience further before concluding the deposition.\nLine 139, 16:07:14: Ms. Garcia: No objection. Please proceed, Mr. Thompson.\nLine 140, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, you mentioned feeling unsure about the specific complaint process at\nLine 141, 16:07:14: Acme. Did you take any steps to learn more about it after your meeting with your supervisor?\nLine 142, 16:07:14: Witness: No, I didn't feel comfortable approaching my supervisor again after their dismissive response.\nLine 143, 16:07:14: Additionally, I recall the employee handbook being quite lengthy, and finding specific information about\nLine 144, 16:07:14: the complaint process proved difficult at the time.\n--- End of Page 5 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 6 ---\nLine 145, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: You mentioned a colleague, Sarah Lopez, who voiced concerns about gender bias. Did\nLine 146, 16:07:14: you ever speak to her directly about her experience and the alleged retaliation she faced?\nLine 147, 16:07:14: Witness: Briefly, yes. We expressed our mutual frustrations and the feeling of being undervalued within\nLine 148, 16:07:14: the department. However, we were both hesitant to pursue any formal complaints due to the\nLine 149, 16:07:14: aforementioned concerns about the company culture and potential retaliation.\nLine 150, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Did you ever discuss the issue of lack of promotion opportunities with any other\nLine 151, 16:07:14: colleagues, particularly women in the marketing department?\nLine 152, 16:07:14: Witness: Not directly. While there were a few women colleagues in the department, none of them were\nLine 153, 16:07:14: in senior positions. The general environment discouraged open communication about potentially\nLine 154, 16:07:14: sensitive topics like discrimination.\nLine 155, 16:07:14: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Thompson, I object to leading the witness. Can you rephrase your question and allow\nLine 156, 16:07:14: Mr. Anderson to answer in his own words?\nLine 157, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Apologies, Ms. Garcia. Mr. Anderson, to clarify, did you have any informal conversations\nLine 158, 16:07:14: with other colleagues about your concerns regarding promotion opportunities or potential gender bias\nLine 159, 16:07:14: within the marketing department at Acme?\nLine 160, 16:07:14: Witness: There weren't any specific discussions about promotions or bias, but the general atmosphere\nLine 161, 16:07:14: around the lack of female representation in senior positions was a frequent topic of quiet observation\nLine 162, 16:07:14: amongst some female colleagues. We felt implicit pressure to work harder and prove ourselves more\nLine 163, 16:07:14: than our male colleagues, but reaching leadership positions seemed like an increasingly distant\nLine 164, 16:07:14: prospect.\nLine 165, 16:07:14: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you elaborate on what kind of \"pressure\" you felt, and was there any\nLine 166, 16:07:14: specific instance or behavior from colleagues or superiors that made you feel this way?\nLine 167, 16:07:14: Summary\nLine 168, 16:07:14: In the concluding segment, Mr. Anderson expresses hope that his experience can contribute to a more\nLine 169, 16:07:14: inclusive work environment at Acme. Mr. Thompson then delves deeper into specific aspects of Mr.\nLine 170, 16:07:14: Anderson's experience:\nLine 171, 16:07:14: Complaint process: Mr. Anderson cites discomfort following his supervisor's reaction and difficulty\nLine 172, 16:07:14: navigating the lengthy employee handbook as reasons for not seeking further information.\nLine 173, 16:07:14: Colleague's experience: He mentions briefly discussing his frustrations and concerns with Sarah Lopez\nLine 174, 16:07:14: but clarifies their shared hesitation to pursue formal complaints due to company culture concerns.\nLine 175, 16:07:14: Promotion opportunities and gender bias: He explains the lack of open communication about these\nLine 176, 16:07:14: issues and feeling unspoken pressure due to the absence of women in senior positions, though no\nLine 177, 16:07:14: specific discussions on bias occurred.\nLine 178, 16:07:14: Ms. Garcia objects to a leading question about bias, and Mr. Thompson rephrases, allowing Mr.\nLine 179, 16:07:14: Anderson to clarify further. He explains the silent observation among female colleagues of the lack of\n--- End of Page 6 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 7 ---\nLine 180, 16:07:14: female leadership and the perceived need to overachieve compared to male colleagues. Ms. Garcia\nLine 181, 16:07:14: requests further details about the pressure felt by Mr. Anderson.\nLine 182, 16:07:14: Deposition\nLine 183, 16:07:14: Witness: It wasn't any direct confrontation or statement, but more of a subtle feeling arising from\nLine 184, 16:07:14: observing the lack of female representation in leadership roles combined with certain comments about\nLine 185, 16:07:14: needing to \"work harder\" or \"prove myself\" despite my consistent positive performance reviews.\nLine 186, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Thank you, Mr. Anderson. These are valuable insights. Do you have any further\nLine 187, 16:07:14: questions, Ms. Garcia?\nLine 188, 16:07:14: Ms. Garcia: (after reviewing her notes) I have a few follow-up questions for clarification. However, due\nLine 189, 16:07:14: to the time constraints, I would like to schedule a follow-up session at your earliest convenience, Mr.\nLine 190, 16:07:14: Thompson, to continue exploring specific details and potential evidence.\nLine 191, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: No objection. Mr. Anderson, are you available for a follow-up session within the next\nLine 192, 16:07:14: week?\nLine 193, 16:07:14: Witness: Yes, I am available. Please let me know the details when you've scheduled it\nLine 194, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, since our last session, have you had any time to review Acme\nLine 195, 16:07:14: Corporation's employee handbook pertaining to the complaint process for potential discrimination?\nLine 196, 16:07:14: Witness: Yes, I have.\nLine 197, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Can you briefly describe the steps outlined in the handbook for filing a complaint based\nLine 198, 16:07:14: on potential discrimination?\nLine 199, 16:07:14: Witness: The handbook mentioned employees could submit a written complaint to the Human\nLine 200, 16:07:14: Resources department or verbally report it to an HR representative or any manager. However, specific\nLine 201, 16:07:14: details about the investigation process or resolution options were quite vague.\nLine 202, 16:07:14: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, did the employee handbook specify who constitutes a \"manager\" authorized\nLine 203, 16:07:14: to receive such initial verbal complaints?\nLine 204, 16:07:14: Witness: No, it didn't provide any specific details about which managers were included in that definition\nLine 205, 16:07:14: or if all managers were authorized to receive such reports.\nLine 206, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, you previously mentioned frustration with receiving similar design\nLine 207, 16:07:14: concepts to yours being chosen over your own work while working at Acme. Do you still have copies of\nLine 208, 16:07:14: these original design concepts and the final versions ultimately used?\nLine 209, 16:07:14: Witness: Unfortunately, I didn't retain individual copies of every design iteration. However, I did\nLine 210, 16:07:14: maintain some preliminary sketches and digital drafts from several projects, including the one discussed\nLine 211, 16:07:14: earlier related to the 2023 product launch campaign.\nLine 212, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Would you be willing to provide these materials as potential evidence in this case?\nLine 213, 16:07:14: Witness: Yes, I can bring them to the next session.\n--- End of Page 7 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 8 ---\nLine 214, 16:07:14: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, are you aware of other colleagues who may have retained copies of their\nLine 215, 16:07:14: rejected design projects or drafts during their employment at Acme?\nLine 216, 16:07:14: Witness: I'm not certain, but I remember several colleagues raising concerns about the inconsistent\nLine 217, 16:07:14: feedback and selection process for design concepts. It's possible some of them might have kept records\nLine 218, 16:07:14: for their own reference.\nLine 219, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: We will look into that possibility. Mr. Anderson, during your time at Acme, did you ever\nLine 220, 16:07:14: meet or hear about any employees who filed official complaints based on experiencing discrimination?\nLine 221, 16:07:14: Witness: Not officially. As mentioned earlier, there was an underlying lack of transparency and open\nLine 222, 16:07:14: communication around potentially sensitive topics like discrimination. Therefore, it was difficult to know\nLine 223, 16:07:14: for sure.\nLine 224, 16:07:14: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, did you receive any additional training or workshops related to diversity and\nLine 225, 16:07:14: inclusion since leaving Acme Corporation?\nLine 226, 16:07:14: Witness: Yes, my current employer offers comprehensive training programs and workshops regarding\nLine 227, 16:07:14: diversity and inclusion as part of their ongoing commitment to a fair and equitable work environment.\nLine 228, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Do you find these additional training programs and the overall work environment at\nLine 229, 16:07:14: your current company to be beneficial compared to your experience at Acme?\nLine 230, 16:07:14: Witness: Absolutely. The focus on creating a safe space for open communication, valuing diverse\nLine 231, 16:07:14: perspectives, and providing equal opportunities for growth has been incredibly positive and\nLine 232, 16:07:14: empowering.\nLine 233, 16:07:14: Ms. Garcia: No further questions at this time.\nLine 234, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, as mentioned previously, we would like you to bring copies of the design\nLine 235, 16:07:14: materials you retained for the next session. Additionally, I may reach out to inquire about potential\nLine 236, 16:07:14: colleagues who might have kept similar records. Is that alright?\nLine 237, 16:07:14: Witness: That's perfectly fine. Please let me know if you need anything else in the meantime.\nLine 238, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, one final question before we adjourn. You mentioned feeling hesitant to\nLine 239, 16:07:14: bring up your concerns to your supervisor after their dismissive response. Did their reaction specifically\nLine 240, 16:07:14: mention any consequences of raising the potential bias issue?\nLine 241, 16:07:14: Witness: Not directly. There wasn't an explicit threat of any sort. However, their dismissive tone and the\nLine 242, 16:07:14: implication that my concerns weren't valid created an atmosphere where I felt further discussion would\nLine 243, 16:07:14: be futile and potentially disadvantageous.\nLine 244, 16:07:14: Ms. Garcia: Objection, speculation about the witness's interpretation of a supervisor's tone is not based\nLine 245, 16:07:14: on facts.\nLine 246, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Reframing, Mr. Anderson. How did your supervisor's response make you feel about the\nLine 247, 16:07:14: potential consequences of reporting your concerns?\n--- End of Page 8 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 9 ---\nLine 248, 16:07:15: Witness: Their response discouraged me and made me feel unheard. It conveyed the impression that my\nLine 249, 16:07:15: concerns about potential bias wouldn't be taken seriously and could potentially hinder my career\nLine 250, 16:07:15: progression within the company.\nLine 251, 16:07:15: Summary\nLine 252, 16:07:15: The concluding segment addresses further details and sets the stage for a follow-up session:\nLine 253, 16:07:15: Complaint process: Mr. Anderson reviews the handbook and describes the outlined steps for filing a\nLine 254, 16:07:15: complaint, noting the vagueness regarding investigation and resolution. Ms. Garcia highlights the lack of\nLine 255, 16:07:15: clarity on who qualifies as a \"manager\" authorized to receive initial verbal reports.\nLine 256, 16:07:15: Design concepts: Mr. Anderson clarifies he still possesses some preliminary sketches and drafts,\nLine 257, 16:07:15: including those from the 2023 product launch, and agrees to provide them as potential evidence. Mr.\nLine 258, 16:07:15: Thompson expresses interest in exploring the possibility of other colleagues retaining similar materials.\nLine 259, 16:07:15: Official complaints: Mr. Anderson reiterates the lack of knowledge about any official discrimination\nLine 260, 16:07:15: complaints at Acme due to the previously mentioned culture of secrecy.\nLine 261, 16:07:15: Current company: Mr. Anderson confirms receiving additional diversity and inclusion training at his\nLine 262, 16:07:15: current company. He emphasizes the positive aspects of his new work environment, highlighting open\nLine 263, 16:07:15: communication, valuing diverse perspectives, and equal opportunities, contrasting it with his experience\nLine 264, 16:07:15: at Acme.\nLine 265, 16:07:15: Follow-up: Both parties agree to a follow-up session. Mr. Thompson clarifies his intention to request the\nLine 266, 16:07:15: design materials and potentially contact other colleagues. Ms. Garcia objects to the witness's\nLine 267, 16:07:15: interpretation of his supervisor's tone, leading Mr. Thompson to rephrase the question, to which Mr.\nLine 268, 16:07:15: Anderson reiterates feeling discouraged and unheard, fearing his concerns wouldn't be taken seriously\nLine 269, 16:07:15: and could hinder his career.\nLine 270, 16:07:15: Deposition\nLine 271, 16:07:15: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Thompson, I believe we've covered the essential topics for today. However, as these are\nLine 272, 16:07:15: complex claims, I would appreciate the opportunity to review the transcript and potentially ask further\nLine 273, 16:07:15: questions at a future session, should any need arise.\nLine 274, 16:07:15: Mr. Thompson: No objection. Mr. Anderson, as Ms. Garcia mentioned, we appreciate your willingness to\nLine 275, 16:07:15: cooperate and provide additional materials. We will be in touch to schedule a follow-up session if\nLine 276, 16:07:15: needed.\nLine 277, 16:07:15: Witness: Understood.\nLine 278, 16:07:15: Summary\nLine 279, 16:07:15: The deposition concludes with Ms. Garcia expressing a desire to review the transcript and potentially\nLine 280, 16:07:15: ask further questions in a future session if needed. Mr. Thompson agrees, and both thank Mr. Anderson\nLine 281, 16:07:15: for his cooperation and willingness to provide additional materials. Mr. Anderson acknowledges their\nLine 282, 16:07:15: communication and awaits further information regarding a potential follow-up session.\n--- End of Page 9 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 10 ---\nLine 283, 16:07:15: Deposition\nLine 284, 16:07:15: MILLER: A driver is obligated to pay attention to the road and yield to other drivers when required. Let\nLine 285, 16:07:15: me take you back to what happened on April 20th, 2022. The Defendant, who was an attorney for the\nLine 286, 16:07:15: IRS, was driving her usual route to work. She drove down Annapolis Road to take a left onto another\nLine 287, 16:07:15: road.\nLine 288, 16:07:15: (Could we have the next slide, please?) She was driving down this road\u2026 can everyone see this? She\nLine 289, 16:07:15: stopped at a light on a clear day. While stopped, she reached down to find her parking pass.\nLine 290, 16:07:15: DEFENSE LAWYER: May we approach?\nLine 291, 16:07:15: THE COURT: Yes.\nLine 292, 16:07:15: BENCH CONFERENCE\nLine 293, 16:07:15: (Bench Conference begins \u2013 10:26:39m.)\nLine 294, 16:07:15: (The parties approach the bench for a discussion.)\nLine 295, 16:07:15: THE COURT: By court ruling, liability has been established. The focus of this case is only on damages. I\nLine 296, 16:07:15: understand why we\u2019re discussing these details, but it\u2019s about damages.\nLine 297, 16:07:15: MILLER: I\u2019m setting the scene for the accident because her damages are part of the accident narrative.\nLine 298, 16:07:15: DEFENSE LAWYER: We\u2019re only discussing the fact that an accident happened and a person was injured.\nLine 299, 16:07:15: The details about reaching and negligence seem to be evidence of liability.\nLine 300, 16:07:15: THE COURT: I understand. It\u2019s your opening statement, so I\u2019ll give you some leeway.\nLine 301, 16:07:15: MILLER: I\u2019m just providing context. I\u2019ll be getting into the damages soon.\nLine 302, 16:07:15: THE COURT: Alright.\nLine 303, 16:07:15: (Bench Conference concluded \u2013 10:27:32 m.)\nLine 304, 16:07:15: (The parties return to their places.)\nLine 305, 16:07:15: MILLER: The Defendant heard a horn beep and took a left turn. She didn\u2019t see the Plaintiff, who had the\nLine 306, 16:07:15: right of way, coming from the opposite direction. Due to the collision, the Plaintiff\u2019s ankle was broken\nLine 307, 16:07:15: and required surgery.\nLine 308, 16:07:15: Take a look at these images. The first one shows her ankle before surgery, the second one after surgery.\nLine 309, 16:07:15: Today, she still has 15 screws and three plates in her ankle. She will never be able to run again and\nLine 310, 16:07:15: standing for extended periods of time is difficult.\nLine 311, 16:07:15: We\u2019ve brought this case before you because of the harm caused to the Plaintiff. We needed to agree\nLine 312, 16:07:15: that the Defendant was at fault for the accident, which she has accepted. We also had to understand the\nLine 313, 16:07:15: extent and implications of the Plaintiff\u2019s damages, not just the initial injury and surgery, but also its long-\nLine 314, 16:07:15: term impact on her life.\nLine 315, 16:07:15: To do this, we spoke to her doctors, her husband, her friends, and even her employer. One of her\nLine 316, 16:07:15: doctors is going to talk to you.\n--- End of Page 10 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 11 ---\nLine 317, 16:07:15: This is the guy to see if something awful like this is going to happen to your ankle. He received an Ivy\nLine 318, 16:07:15: League education and, at one point, was the chief of foot and ankle orthopedic injuries at Johns\nLine 319, 16:07:15: Hopkins. He consults for the Baltimore Orioles. His resume, I want to say, is as long as your arm, but it\u2019s\nLine 320, 16:07:15: actually a lot longer than that.\nLine 321, 16:07:15: We\u2019re going to bring him to talk to you guys, in a very 2023 way. It\u2019s going to be by videotape, so his\nLine 322, 16:07:15: testimony will be by videotape, but it holds the same force as if it was at trial, and he came here to see\nLine 323, 16:07:15: us. And, of course, my partner Laura Zois and the defense attorney had an opportunity to ask him\nLine 324, 16:07:15: questions.\nLine 325, 16:07:15: He\u2019s going to tell you she still has 15 screws and three plates in her ankle holding everything together.\nLine 326, 16:07:15: The problem with that is that it creates a breeding ground for arthritis, and this 33-year-old woman\nLine 327, 16:07:15: already has the signs of arthritis. At some point, she\u2019s going to need what\u2019s called a fusion, which will\nLine 328, 16:07:15: stabilize her ankle. The bad news is, you can\u2019t move it once it locks, so you no longer have the ability to\nLine 329, 16:07:15: bend.\nLine 330, 16:07:15: This trial is about the harms and losses that she has suffered and endured as the result of this accident.\nLine 331, 16:07:15: This is not a case about sympathy. You should not award her damages because you feel sorry for her.\nLine 332, 16:07:15: You\u2019re going to hear about how the accident has impacted her professional and personal life.\nLine 333, 16:07:15: At the time of the crash, they were a very young family. They were an energetic family. This is an active\nLine 334, 16:07:15: family with four kids doing everything you can imagine, Six Flags, the park. They would run together.\nLine 335, 16:07:15: They played basketball together. They traveled everywhere, New York, Baltimore, Washington, DC. They\nLine 336, 16:07:15: were just a very active family.\nLine 337, 16:07:15: And she also had a vibrant social life. She was a hairstylist, and she loved that job. It was her social outlet\nLine 338, 16:07:15: beside her kids. She would do the church choir every Wednesday, and still found times to go out and see\nLine 339, 16:07:15: her family. She\u2019s still fighting with her family, but it\u2019s hard.\nLine 340, 16:07:15: She can\u2019t work as a hairstylist anymore. So what did she do? She went back to school to the University\nLine 341, 16:07:15: of Maryland. She\u2019s working, getting very close to getting her degree. She\u2019s still fighting. She has four kids\nLine 342, 16:07:15: they\u2019re chasing around.\nLine 343, 16:07:15: Let\u2019s go back and talk about how it ended up. Let\u2019s talk about the accident. She had this awful crash and\nLine 344, 16:07:15: needed emergency surgery where they put in these screws. She had a nine-month-old baby, along with\nLine 345, 16:07:15: three other kids. She and the two girls, the younger ones, went to live with her mom. Her mom took\nLine 346, 16:07:15: care of her and the girls, while her husband took care of the other kids.\nLine 347, 16:07:15: This has been a massive disruption to their lives. The accident has completely changed her life, and it\u2019s\nLine 348, 16:07:15: reflected in every facet of her day-to-day. Her job, her family life, her hobbies, everything she used to\nLine 349, 16:07:15: take pleasure in has been impacted in one way or another. And the evidence in this case will show these\nLine 350, 16:07:15: changes are likely to persist for the rest of her life.\nLine 351, 16:07:15: We ask you to consider the totality of these changes, the persistent harm and loss she\u2019s suffered and\nLine 352, 16:07:15: will continue to suffer, as a direct result of the accident. We ask you to consider these when coming to a\nLine 353, 16:07:15: decision in this case.\n--- End of Page 11 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 12 ---\nLine 354, 16:07:15: This accident, however, led to an upheaval in their lives. About a month after the accident, she managed\nLine 355, 16:07:15: to return home with the kids. Her mother, an FDA employee, took three months off work to care for her,\nLine 356, 16:07:15: her daughter, and her grandchildren. The accident wreaked havoc on their lives.\nLine 357, 16:07:15: She endured six months of rigorous physical therapy and another operation. While it was painful and\nLine 358, 16:07:15: difficult, the effort was worthwhile as it improved her condition, especially her ankle, though we wish\nLine 359, 16:07:15: she had recovered more.\nLine 360, 16:07:15: As we delve into this case, it\u2019s about the harm and losses experienced. We will ask you to make amends\nLine 361, 16:07:15: where possible and provide compensation for the irreparable harm. The damages can be categorized\nLine 362, 16:07:15: into three parts: her medical bills, the post-accident trauma suffered by her and her family, and the pain\nLine 363, 16:07:15: she will endure for the expected next 45 years of her life.\nLine 364, 16:07:15: She was a spontaneous person, fond of making impromptu plans like going to Virginia Beach over the\nLine 365, 16:07:15: weekend or heading to the park. Now, every activity revolves around her ability to reach there, her\nLine 366, 16:07:15: mobility, and whether she can tolerate the pain during the trip. This situation has affected her and her\nLine 367, 16:07:15: four kids, as well as her husband.\nLine 368, 16:07:15: The court wants to clarify that the evidence and testimonies from the witness stand are what will\nLine 369, 16:07:15: control your deliberations. Opening statements and closing arguments of lawyers do not constitute\nLine 370, 16:07:15: evidence.\nLine 371, 16:07:15: This case is not just about the suffering of their children or her husband. It\u2019s about the impact of their\nLine 372, 16:07:15: suffering on her. We will ask you to consider an amount that may seem high at the beginning. But we\nLine 373, 16:07:15: believe that after hearing all the evidence, you\u2019ll find it to be a fair compensation for her losses and\nLine 374, 16:07:15: harm. The amount we suggest is $1.1 million.\nLine 375, 16:07:15: Defense Opening Statement\nLine 376, 16:07:15: Regarding the defendant, they acknowledge the responsibility for the accident and that it was their\nLine 377, 16:07:15: fault. The case is for you to determine the appropriate damages. The injury is severe, and they ask for an\nLine 378, 16:07:15: extraordinary amount of compensation.\nLine 379, 16:07:15: She broke her ankle, which was repaired surgically with plates and screws. There was a second surgery\nLine 380, 16:07:15: due to loosening of the screws, which were then removed. She attended physical therapy, which\nLine 381, 16:07:15: improved her ability to move her ankle. Whether she will need surgery in the future is uncertain.\nLine 382, 16:07:15: The past medical expenses are around $36,505, which we don\u2019t contest. Her lost wages due to the\nLine 383, 16:07:15: accident are around $3,400 to $3,500. These are not the focal points of this case. The main issue is the\nLine 384, 16:07:15: amount to be awarded for non-economic damages, for which we request something fair, reasonable,\nLine 385, 16:07:15: and sensible.\nLine 386, 16:07:15: Thank you for your time and attention, and we hope to conclude this case promptly.\nLine 387, 16:07:15: Testimony of Victim\u2019s Husband\nLine 388, 16:07:15: Mr. Miller: Good morning. Can I have your address?\nLine 389, 16:07:15: SJ: Certainly.\nLine 390, 16:07:15: Mr. Miller: How long have you lived at that address?\n--- End of Page 12 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 13 ---\nLine 391, 16:07:16: SJ: I bought the house in 2003, so it\u2019s been approximately ten years.\nLine 392, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Who lives there with you?\nLine 393, 16:07:16: SJ: My wife, and our four children.\nLine 394, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Can you tell the jury how old your children are and their names?\nLine 395, 16:07:16: SJ: Yes. My children are 13, and the others are\u2026\nLine 396, 16:07:16: The Honorable Judge: Please continue.\nLine 397, 16:07:16: SJ: \u2026five, and three.\nLine 398, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: I understand. And for some background, what do you do for a living?\nLine 399, 16:07:16: SJ: I\u2019m currently the general manager at Oreck Clean Home Center.\nLine 400, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: And where are these locations?\nLine 401, 16:07:16: SJ: We have six locations in Maryland and Virginia.\nLine 402, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: What are your responsibilities at work?\nLine 403, 16:07:16: SJ: I oversee all six stores and manage one of them.\nLine 404, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Can you describe your work schedule?\nLine 405, 16:07:16: SJ: I work Monday through Saturday, from 10:00 am to 7:00 pm. Often, I work seven days a week which\nLine 406, 16:07:16: means working on Sundays from 12:00 pm to 5:00 pm.\nLine 407, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: How do you feel about those hours?\nLine 408, 16:07:16: SJ: They are long, but I need to work to support my family.\nLine 409, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: How long have you known your wife?\nLine 410, 16:07:16: SJ: I met her in 1993, she was my sister\u2019s best friend.\nLine 411, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: You mean your wife was your sister\u2019s best friend?\nLine 412, 16:07:16: SJ: Yes, I apologize for the confusion. She was indeed my sister\u2019s best friend.\nLine 413, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Let\u2019s move to another topic. Do you remember the car accident your wife was in 2022?\nLine 414, 16:07:16: SJ: Yes, I do.\nLine 415, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Prior to the accident, can you describe your household?\nLine 416, 16:07:16: SJ: Our household was what I would consider the perfect life. My wife and children were happy and\nLine 417, 16:07:16: always engaged in activities. We used to take vacations and attend family reunions.\nLine 418, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Was your wife a spontaneous person or a planner?\nLine 419, 16:07:16: SJ: She was more spontaneous, always ready to take on new activities.\n--- End of Page 13 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 14 ---\nLine 420, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Could you describe her for the jury?\nLine 421, 16:07:16: SJ: She is always happy, loves socializing and helping people. She attended choir rehearsal, Bible study\nLine 422, 16:07:16: every week, and also took care of our four children.\nLine 423, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: What was her job at the time of the crash?\nLine 424, 16:07:16: SJ: She was the assistant manager of a hair salon.\nLine 425, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Did she enjoy her work?\nLine 426, 16:07:16: SJ: Yes, she loved her work. It was part of her identity.\nLine 427, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Did your wife\u2019s demeanor change after the car accident?\nLine 428, 16:07:16: SJ: Yes, after the accident everything changed. Our family life and activity level changed significantly. She\nLine 429, 16:07:16: used to take the children to sporting events and practice basketball. Now, she can\u2019t do these activities.\nLine 430, 16:07:16: She no longer goes on family vacations. My two older sons call her \u201cboring\u201d now because of her reduced\nLine 431, 16:07:16: activity level. The accident has restricted her capabilities and as a result, she can\u2019t even do simple tasks\nLine 432, 16:07:16: like carrying laundry baskets or standing up to cook. Our family life has changed drastically since the\nLine 433, 16:07:16: accident.\nLine 434, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Has your wife gone back to work since the accident?\nLine 435, 16:07:16: SJ: She tried to help a friend out a couple of months ago at her hair salon, but it ended with her in a lot\nLine 436, 16:07:16: of pain due to the swelling in her ankle.\nLine 437, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: I have here a picture you received from your wife. Is this the picture she sent you?\nLine 438, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Can you tell us how your wife\u2019s personal social life has been affected since the crash?\nLine 439, 16:07:16: SJ: Her social life has indeed changed significantly. Before the accident, she would regularly go out with\nLine 440, 16:07:16: friends, engage in dancing, and other social activities. However, the constant pain and discomfort after\nLine 441, 16:07:16: the crash have made such activities impossible. Her social life is definitely not the same as before.\nLine 442, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: You mentioned earlier about her job. Was she able to resume work post the crash?\nLine 443, 16:07:16: SJ: She attempted to return to work, but the persistent pain made it unmanageable, particularly the\nLine 444, 16:07:16: long-standing hours. Eventually, she was forced to leave her job.\nLine 445, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: How has this situation impacted your family\u2019s finances?\nLine 446, 16:07:16: SJ: The impact has been substantial. She held the position of an assistant manager at a hair salon,\nLine 447, 16:07:16: bringing in a significant income. Now, with my single income, managing expenses for our four children\nLine 448, 16:07:16: and her medical bills has been strenuous.\nLine 449, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Besides the financial struggle, can you share how your relationship with your wife has\nLine 450, 16:07:16: evolved post the accident?\nLine 451, 16:07:16: SJ: Our relationship has undeniably been affected. She isn\u2019t the same person she was before the crash.\nLine 452, 16:07:16: Her constant pain and fatigue, coupled with frustration, have been hard on both of us.\nLine 453, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: And your children? How have they been coping with all these changes?\n--- End of Page 14 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 15 ---\nLine 454, 16:07:16: SJ: Our children have had to make significant adjustments. They miss the mother they had before the\nLine 455, 16:07:16: crash, not understanding why she can\u2019t engage in the activities she used to do with them. My older\nLine 456, 16:07:16: sons, in particular, have had to step up, assisting more with household chores. It\u2019s been a lot for them\nLine 457, 16:07:16: too.\nLine 458, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Finally, could you share your hopes for your wife\u2019s future?\nLine 459, 16:07:16: SJ: My biggest hope is for her to find relief from her pain and regain some semblance of normalcy. She\nLine 460, 16:07:16: deserves to live her life, not just endure it. It\u2019s challenging to see such a wonderful person go through\nLine 461, 16:07:16: this. We are taking each day as it comes, hoping for a better future.\nLine 462, 16:07:16: Defense Attorney Cross Examination of Victim\u2019s Husband\nLine 463, 16:07:16: Q: Regarding the foot stretching exercises, you assist her with those?\nLine 464, 16:07:16: A: Yes, I do.\nLine 465, 16:07:16: Q: Looking through her medical records, I noticed there\u2019s mention of an exercise bike at home. Do you\nLine 466, 16:07:16: have one?\nLine 467, 16:07:16: A: Indeed, we do have an exercise bike at home.\nLine 468, 16:07:16: Q: Did she frequently use the exercise bike, especially post-accident?\nLine 469, 16:07:16: A: Initially, during her therapy, they had her try riding the exercise bike.\nLine 470, 16:07:16: Q: Can you tell us what kind of exercises she did at home after the accident?\nLine 471, 16:07:16: A: She was given a chart with exercises, and I\u2019ve been helping her to flex her foot in both directions to\nLine 472, 16:07:16: try and loosen it up.\nLine 473, 16:07:16: Q: How long did this routine last?\nLine 474, 16:07:16: A: Actually, I still assist her with the foot exercises every night.\nLine 475, 16:07:16: Q: So you assist her based on the instructions from the chart?\nLine 476, 16:07:16: A: Not directly from the chart, but I\u2019ve learned the correct angles and try to flex her foot every night for\nLine 477, 16:07:16: her comfort and to aid her sleep.\nLine 478, 16:07:16: Q: Does she drive?\nLine 479, 16:07:16: A: Yes, she does.\nLine 480, 16:07:16: Q: Prior to the accident, she was employed full time?\nLine 481, 16:07:16: A: Yes, that\u2019s correct.\nLine 482, 16:07:16: Q: The jury was informed initially that she was also pursuing a degree?\nLine 483, 16:07:16: A: Yes, she was attending the University of Maryland.\nLine 484, 16:07:16: Q: Did she commute to the university?\nLine 485, 16:07:16: A: At certain points she did, but due to our four children, she primarily takes her classes online now.\n--- End of Page 15 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 16 ---\nLine 486, 16:07:16: Q: How close is she to obtaining her degree?\nLine 487, 16:07:16: A: She\u2019s expected to graduate within the next year.\nLine 488, 16:07:16: Court: Any redirect?\nLine 489, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: No further questions, Your Honor.\nLine 490, 16:07:16: Court: Thank you, sir, you may step down.

I was waiting at the red light on Maple Avenue, southbound, facing east.\nLine 12, 16:07:13: Mr. Brown: Did you witness any accidents at that intersection at that time?\nLine 13, 16:07:13: Witness: Yes, I did. I saw a car traveling westbound on Main Street, which I believe was a blue sedan, run\nLine 14, 16:07:13: the red light and collide with a car traveling northbound on Maple Avenue, which I believe was a white\nLine 15, 16:07:13: SUV.\nLine 16, 16:07:13: Mr. Brown: Can you describe the collision in more detail?\nLine 17, 16:07:13: Witness: The blue sedan seemed to be traveling at a high speed and didn't slow down or attempt to stop\nLine 18, 16:07:13: at the red light. It hit the white SUV directly on the driver's side. The impact was quite forceful, and both\nLine 19, 16:07:13: cars spun around significantly.\nLine 20, 16:07:13: Mr. Lee: Ms. Miller, you mentioned the blue sedan was traveling at a high speed. How fast would you\nLine 21, 16:07:13: say it was going?\nLine 22, 16:07:13: Witness: It's difficult to say for sure, but it appeared to be going much faster than the posted speed\nLine 23, 16:07:13: limit, which is 35 miles per hour.\nLine 24, 16:07:13: Mr. Lee: Did you see the driver of either vehicle at any point?\nLine 25, 16:07:13: Witness: No, I didn't.\nLine 26, 16:07:13: Mr. Brown: Ms. Miller, did you notice anything unusual about the driver's behavior in the blue sedan\nLine 27, 16:07:13: before the accident?\nLine 28, 16:07:13: Witness: It's hard to say.

I\nLine 50, 16:07:13: was also consistently passed over for promotions despite having experience and qualifications\nLine 51, 16:07:13: comparable to others who got promoted.\nLine 52, 16:07:13: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you be specific about which colleagues treated you this way and provide\nLine 53, 16:07:13: specific examples of situations where these incidents occurred?\nLine 54, 16:07:13: Witness: One specific example would be the marketing campaign for the new product launch in 2023. I\nLine 55, 16:07:13: put significant effort into developing design concepts, but they were ultimately disregarded without any\nLine 56, 16:07:13: explanation. My male colleague's design, which was very similar to mine, was ultimately chosen.\nLine 57, 16:07:13: Mr. Thompson: Did you ever report any of these incidents to your supervisor or anyone else at Acme?\nLine 58, 16:07:13: Witness: I once mentioned feeling undervalued to my supervisor, but they brushed it off, suggesting I\nLine 59, 16:07:13: needed to \"work harder to prove myself.\" I wasn't comfortable bringing it up further after that.\nLine 60, 16:07:13: Mr. Thompson: Did you decide to leave Acme voluntarily, or were you terminated?\nLine 61, 16:07:13: Witness: When they announced another promotion I felt qualified for, but was once again passed over\nLine 62, 16:07:13: without explanation, I decided it was time to find a new position where I felt valued and respected.\nLine 63, 16:07:13: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you confirm that your decision to leave Acme was solely based on not\nLine 64, 16:07:13: receiving the promotion, and not due to other factors like job performance or personal reasons?\nLine 65, 16:07:13: Witness: To the best of my knowledge, yes. It became clear to me that further advancement\nLine 66, 16:07:13: opportunities within the company were unlikely.\nLine 67, 16:07:13: Mr. Thompson: That's all my questions at this time.\nLine 68, 16:07:13: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, during your time at Acme, did you ever receive any negative performance\nLine 69, 16:07:13: reviews or warnings related to your work performance?\nLine 70, 16:07:13: Witness: No, as mentioned before, my performance reviews were always positive.\nLine 71, 16:07:13: Ms. Garcia: Did you ever attend any diversity and inclusion training offered by Acme during your\nLine 72, 16:07:13: employment?\nLine 73, 16:07:13: Witness: I did participate in the mandatory online training modules, but there weren't any specific\nLine 74, 16:07:13: training sessions related to addressing or reporting potentially discriminatory situations within the\nLine 75, 16:07:13: company.\nLine 76, 16:07:13: Summary\n--- End of Page 3 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 4 ---\nLine 77, 16:07:13: Michael Anderson details specific incidents supporting his feeling of being undervalued based on his\nLine 78, 16:07:13: protected category. He describes colleagues disregarding his ideas and being passed over for\nLine 79, 16:07:13: promotions despite comparable qualifications. He provides a specific example from the 2023 product\nLine 80, 16:07:13: launch where his design was overlooked in favor of a male colleague's similar work. He mentions\nLine 81, 16:07:13: mentioning his concerns to his supervisor but being discouraged from pursuing them. He clarifies his\nLine 82, 16:07:13: decision to leave Acme was due to the lack of advancement opportunities, not performance or personal\nLine 83, 16:07:13: reasons. Ms. Garcia then establishes that Mr. Anderson's performance was consistently good and that\nLine 84, 16:07:13: he participated in available diversity training while at Acme, though specific training for addressing\nLine 85, 16:07:13: potential discrimination was absent.\nLine 86, 16:07:13: Deposition:\nLine 87, 16:07:13: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, are you aware of Acme's anti-discrimination policy or how complaints of\nLine 88, 16:07:13: discrimination are addressed within the company?\nLine 89, 16:07:13: Witness: I reviewed the employee handbook, which did explain the existence of an anti-discrimination\nLine 90, 16:07:13: policy. However, I was unsure of the specific complaint process at the time\nLine 91, 16:07:13: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you elaborate on why you felt apprehensive about bringing up these\nLine 92, 16:07:13: incidents to your supervisor despite feeling uncomfortable and undervalued?\nLine 93, 16:07:13: Witness: Honestly, there were a few reasons. Firstly, as I mentioned, when I did hint at feeling\nLine 94, 16:07:13: undervalued to my supervisor, their dismissive response discouraged me from further discussions. It\nLine 95, 16:07:13: seemed like they weren't receptive to hearing about any potential issues.\nLine 96, 16:07:13: Secondly, there was a general company culture that made me hesitant to speak up. Younger male\nLine 97, 16:07:13: colleagues often dominated conversations and presentations, and there weren't many women in senior\nLine 98, 16:07:13: positions within the marketing department. It felt like my voice wouldn't be heard or even worse, that\nLine 99, 16:07:13: bringing forward complaints might lead to retaliation or hinder my career further.\nLine 100, 16:07:13: Ms. Garcia: Did you notice any specific instances of retaliation against other employees who may have\nLine 101, 16:07:13: raised complaints or concerns about work environment issues?\nLine 102, 16:07:13: Witness: While I can't say for sure, there was one colleague, Sarah Lopez, who openly challenged gender\nLine 103, 16:07:13: bias during a department meeting but was subsequently given less desirable project assignments\nLine 104, 16:07:13: compared to her male colleagues. This incident definitely reinforced my concerns about potentially\nLine 105, 16:07:13: facing a similar situation.**\nLine 106, 16:07:13: Mr. Thompson: Objection, speculation about an unrelated case is irrelevant to the present matter.\nLine 107, 16:07:13: Ms. Garcia: Withdrawn. Mr. Anderson, did you ever discuss your concerns about potential bias or lack of\nLine 108, 16:07:13: promotion opportunities with any human resources personnel at Acme?\nLine 109, 16:07:13: Witness: No, I didn't. As I mentioned before, the lack of clarity on the specific complaint process\nLine 110, 16:07:13: combined with the overall culture discouraged me from pursuing that route.\nLine 111, 16:07:13: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, since leaving Acme, have you sought employment elsewhere?\n--- End of Page 4 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 5 ---\nLine 112, 16:07:14: Witness: Yes, I am currently employed at a different company and feel much more valued and respected\nLine 113, 16:07:14: in my current role. The work environment is significantly more inclusive, and I regularly receive positive\nLine 114, 16:07:14: feedback and opportunities for professional development.\nLine 115, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, how has your experience at Acme impacted you personally and\nLine 116, 16:07:14: professionally?\nLine 117, 16:07:14: Witness: It was definitely a frustrating and discouraging experience. It felt like my hard work and\nLine 118, 16:07:14: qualifications weren't being recognized fairly, leading to some self-doubt and a sense of being\nLine 119, 16:07:14: undervalued. However, finding a new and positive work environment has helped me rebuild my\nLine 120, 16:07:14: confidence and refocus on my career goals.\nLine 121, 16:07:14: Ms. Garcia: I have no further questions.\nLine 122, 16:07:14: Summary\nLine 123, 16:07:14: This segment explores Mr. Anderson's reasons for not formally complaining despite feeling undervalued.\nLine 124, 16:07:14: He reiterates his supervisor's dismissive response and the perceived lack of receptiveness within the\nLine 125, 16:07:14: company culture. He describes a specific instance where a colleague who challenged gender bias faced\nLine 126, 16:07:14: negative consequences, reinforcing his fear of retaliation. He clarifies that he didn't pursue HR due to\nLine 127, 16:07:14: unclear procedures and the discouraging company culture. Finally, he highlights his positive experience\nLine 128, 16:07:14: at a new company, emphasizing feelings of value, inclusion, and professional growth in contrast to his\nLine 129, 16:07:14: experience at Acme. He concludes by acknowledging the frustration and self-doubt from Acme but also\nLine 130, 16:07:14: the positive impact of finding a supportive work environment.\nLine 131, 16:07:14: Deposition\nLine 132, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: I have one final question. Mr. Anderson, is there anything else you would like to add\nLine 133, 16:07:14: regarding your experience at Acme Corporation?\nLine 134, 16:07:14: Witness: Just that I hope by sharing my story, it can contribute to fostering a more diverse and inclusive\nLine 135, 16:07:14: work environment at Acme for future employees. Everyone deserves to feel valued and respected in\nLine 136, 16:07:14: their workplace, regardless of their [protected category].\nLine 137, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Interesting point, Mr. Anderson. Ms. Garcia, while you have no further questions, I'd like\nLine 138, 16:07:14: to explore some aspects of Mr. Anderson's experience further before concluding the deposition.\nLine 139, 16:07:14: Ms. Garcia: No objection. Please proceed, Mr. Thompson.\nLine 140, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, you mentioned feeling unsure about the specific complaint process at\nLine 141, 16:07:14: Acme. Did you take any steps to learn more about it after your meeting with your supervisor?\nLine 142, 16:07:14: Witness: No, I didn't feel comfortable approaching my supervisor again after their dismissive response.\nLine 143, 16:07:14: Additionally, I recall the employee handbook being quite lengthy, and finding specific information about\nLine 144, 16:07:14: the complaint process proved difficult at the time.\n--- End of Page 5 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 6 ---\nLine 145, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: You mentioned a colleague, Sarah Lopez, who voiced concerns about gender bias. Did\nLine 146, 16:07:14: you ever speak to her directly about her experience and the alleged retaliation she faced?\nLine 147, 16:07:14: Witness: Briefly, yes. We expressed our mutual frustrations and the feeling of being undervalued within\nLine 148, 16:07:14: the department. However, we were both hesitant to pursue any formal complaints due to the\nLine 149, 16:07:14: aforementioned concerns about the company culture and potential retaliation.\nLine 150, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Did you ever discuss the issue of lack of promotion opportunities with any other\nLine 151, 16:07:14: colleagues, particularly women in the marketing department?\nLine 152, 16:07:14: Witness: Not directly. While there were a few women colleagues in the department, none of them were\nLine 153, 16:07:14: in senior positions. The general environment discouraged open communication about potentially\nLine 154, 16:07:14: sensitive topics like discrimination.\nLine 155, 16:07:14: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Thompson, I object to leading the witness. Can you rephrase your question and allow\nLine 156, 16:07:14: Mr. Anderson to answer in his own words?\nLine 157, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Apologies, Ms. Garcia. Mr. Anderson, to clarify, did you have any informal conversations\nLine 158, 16:07:14: with other colleagues about your concerns regarding promotion opportunities or potential gender bias\nLine 159, 16:07:14: within the marketing department at Acme?\nLine 160, 16:07:14: Witness: There weren't any specific discussions about promotions or bias, but the general atmosphere\nLine 161, 16:07:14: around the lack of female representation in senior positions was a frequent topic of quiet observation\nLine 162, 16:07:14: amongst some female colleagues. We felt implicit pressure to work harder and prove ourselves more\nLine 163, 16:07:14: than our male colleagues, but reaching leadership positions seemed like an increasingly distant\nLine 164, 16:07:14: prospect.\nLine 165, 16:07:14: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, can you elaborate on what kind of \"pressure\" you felt, and was there any\nLine 166, 16:07:14: specific instance or behavior from colleagues or superiors that made you feel this way?\nLine 167, 16:07:14: Summary\nLine 168, 16:07:14: In the concluding segment, Mr. Anderson expresses hope that his experience can contribute to a more\nLine 169, 16:07:14: inclusive work environment at Acme. Mr. Thompson then delves deeper into specific aspects of Mr.\nLine 170, 16:07:14: Anderson's experience:\nLine 171, 16:07:14: Complaint process: Mr. Anderson cites discomfort following his supervisor's reaction and difficulty\nLine 172, 16:07:14: navigating the lengthy employee handbook as reasons for not seeking further information.\nLine 173, 16:07:14: Colleague's experience: He mentions briefly discussing his frustrations and concerns with Sarah Lopez\nLine 174, 16:07:14: but clarifies their shared hesitation to pursue formal complaints due to company culture concerns.\nLine 175, 16:07:14: Promotion opportunities and gender bias: He explains the lack of open communication about these\nLine 176, 16:07:14: issues and feeling unspoken pressure due to the absence of women in senior positions, though no\nLine 177, 16:07:14: specific discussions on bias occurred.\nLine 178, 16:07:14: Ms. Garcia objects to a leading question about bias, and Mr. Thompson rephrases, allowing Mr.\nLine 179, 16:07:14: Anderson to clarify further. He explains the silent observation among female colleagues of the lack of\n--- End of Page 6 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 7 ---\nLine 180, 16:07:14: female leadership and the perceived need to overachieve compared to male colleagues. Ms. Garcia\nLine 181, 16:07:14: requests further details about the pressure felt by Mr. Anderson.\nLine 182, 16:07:14: Deposition\nLine 183, 16:07:14: Witness: It wasn't any direct confrontation or statement, but more of a subtle feeling arising from\nLine 184, 16:07:14: observing the lack of female representation in leadership roles combined with certain comments about\nLine 185, 16:07:14: needing to \"work harder\" or \"prove myself\" despite my consistent positive performance reviews.\nLine 186, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Thank you, Mr. Anderson. These are valuable insights. Do you have any further\nLine 187, 16:07:14: questions, Ms. Garcia?\nLine 188, 16:07:14: Ms. Garcia: (after reviewing her notes) I have a few follow-up questions for clarification. However, due\nLine 189, 16:07:14: to the time constraints, I would like to schedule a follow-up session at your earliest convenience, Mr.\nLine 190, 16:07:14: Thompson, to continue exploring specific details and potential evidence.\nLine 191, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: No objection. Mr. Anderson, are you available for a follow-up session within the next\nLine 192, 16:07:14: week?\nLine 193, 16:07:14: Witness: Yes, I am available. Please let me know the details when you've scheduled it\nLine 194, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, since our last session, have you had any time to review Acme\nLine 195, 16:07:14: Corporation's employee handbook pertaining to the complaint process for potential discrimination?\nLine 196, 16:07:14: Witness: Yes, I have.\nLine 197, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Can you briefly describe the steps outlined in the handbook for filing a complaint based\nLine 198, 16:07:14: on potential discrimination?\nLine 199, 16:07:14: Witness: The handbook mentioned employees could submit a written complaint to the Human\nLine 200, 16:07:14: Resources department or verbally report it to an HR representative or any manager. However, specific\nLine 201, 16:07:14: details about the investigation process or resolution options were quite vague.\nLine 202, 16:07:14: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, did the employee handbook specify who constitutes a \"manager\" authorized\nLine 203, 16:07:14: to receive such initial verbal complaints?\nLine 204, 16:07:14: Witness: No, it didn't provide any specific details about which managers were included in that definition\nLine 205, 16:07:14: or if all managers were authorized to receive such reports.\nLine 206, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, you previously mentioned frustration with receiving similar design\nLine 207, 16:07:14: concepts to yours being chosen over your own work while working at Acme. Do you still have copies of\nLine 208, 16:07:14: these original design concepts and the final versions ultimately used?\nLine 209, 16:07:14: Witness: Unfortunately, I didn't retain individual copies of every design iteration. However, I did\nLine 210, 16:07:14: maintain some preliminary sketches and digital drafts from several projects, including the one discussed\nLine 211, 16:07:14: earlier related to the 2023 product launch campaign.\nLine 212, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Would you be willing to provide these materials as potential evidence in this case?\nLine 213, 16:07:14: Witness: Yes, I can bring them to the next session.\n--- End of Page 7 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 8 ---\nLine 214, 16:07:14: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, are you aware of other colleagues who may have retained copies of their\nLine 215, 16:07:14: rejected design projects or drafts during their employment at Acme?\nLine 216, 16:07:14: Witness: I'm not certain, but I remember several colleagues raising concerns about the inconsistent\nLine 217, 16:07:14: feedback and selection process for design concepts. It's possible some of them might have kept records\nLine 218, 16:07:14: for their own reference.\nLine 219, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: We will look into that possibility. Mr. Anderson, during your time at Acme, did you ever\nLine 220, 16:07:14: meet or hear about any employees who filed official complaints based on experiencing discrimination?\nLine 221, 16:07:14: Witness: Not officially. As mentioned earlier, there was an underlying lack of transparency and open\nLine 222, 16:07:14: communication around potentially sensitive topics like discrimination. Therefore, it was difficult to know\nLine 223, 16:07:14: for sure.\nLine 224, 16:07:14: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Anderson, did you receive any additional training or workshops related to diversity and\nLine 225, 16:07:14: inclusion since leaving Acme Corporation?\nLine 226, 16:07:14: Witness: Yes, my current employer offers comprehensive training programs and workshops regarding\nLine 227, 16:07:14: diversity and inclusion as part of their ongoing commitment to a fair and equitable work environment.\nLine 228, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Do you find these additional training programs and the overall work environment at\nLine 229, 16:07:14: your current company to be beneficial compared to your experience at Acme?\nLine 230, 16:07:14: Witness: Absolutely. The focus on creating a safe space for open communication, valuing diverse\nLine 231, 16:07:14: perspectives, and providing equal opportunities for growth has been incredibly positive and\nLine 232, 16:07:14: empowering.\nLine 233, 16:07:14: Ms. Garcia: No further questions at this time.\nLine 234, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, as mentioned previously, we would like you to bring copies of the design\nLine 235, 16:07:14: materials you retained for the next session. Additionally, I may reach out to inquire about potential\nLine 236, 16:07:14: colleagues who might have kept similar records. Is that alright?\nLine 237, 16:07:14: Witness: That's perfectly fine. Please let me know if you need anything else in the meantime.\nLine 238, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Mr. Anderson, one final question before we adjourn. You mentioned feeling hesitant to\nLine 239, 16:07:14: bring up your concerns to your supervisor after their dismissive response. Did their reaction specifically\nLine 240, 16:07:14: mention any consequences of raising the potential bias issue?\nLine 241, 16:07:14: Witness: Not directly. There wasn't an explicit threat of any sort. However, their dismissive tone and the\nLine 242, 16:07:14: implication that my concerns weren't valid created an atmosphere where I felt further discussion would\nLine 243, 16:07:14: be futile and potentially disadvantageous.\nLine 244, 16:07:14: Ms. Garcia: Objection, speculation about the witness's interpretation of a supervisor's tone is not based\nLine 245, 16:07:14: on facts.\nLine 246, 16:07:14: Mr. Thompson: Reframing, Mr. Anderson. How did your supervisor's response make you feel about the\nLine 247, 16:07:14: potential consequences of reporting your concerns?\n--- End of Page 8 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 9 ---\nLine 248, 16:07:15: Witness: Their response discouraged me and made me feel unheard. It conveyed the impression that my\nLine 249, 16:07:15: concerns about potential bias wouldn't be taken seriously and could potentially hinder my career\nLine 250, 16:07:15: progression within the company.\nLine 251, 16:07:15: Summary\nLine 252, 16:07:15: The concluding segment addresses further details and sets the stage for a follow-up session:\nLine 253, 16:07:15: Complaint process: Mr. Anderson reviews the handbook and describes the outlined steps for filing a\nLine 254, 16:07:15: complaint, noting the vagueness regarding investigation and resolution. Ms. Garcia highlights the lack of\nLine 255, 16:07:15: clarity on who qualifies as a \"manager\" authorized to receive initial verbal reports.\nLine 256, 16:07:15: Design concepts: Mr. Anderson clarifies he still possesses some preliminary sketches and drafts,\nLine 257, 16:07:15: including those from the 2023 product launch, and agrees to provide them as potential evidence. Mr.\nLine 258, 16:07:15: Thompson expresses interest in exploring the possibility of other colleagues retaining similar materials.\nLine 259, 16:07:15: Official complaints: Mr. Anderson reiterates the lack of knowledge about any official discrimination\nLine 260, 16:07:15: complaints at Acme due to the previously mentioned culture of secrecy.\nLine 261, 16:07:15: Current company: Mr. Anderson confirms receiving additional diversity and inclusion training at his\nLine 262, 16:07:15: current company. He emphasizes the positive aspects of his new work environment, highlighting open\nLine 263, 16:07:15: communication, valuing diverse perspectives, and equal opportunities, contrasting it with his experience\nLine 264, 16:07:15: at Acme.\nLine 265, 16:07:15: Follow-up: Both parties agree to a follow-up session. Mr. Thompson clarifies his intention to request the\nLine 266, 16:07:15: design materials and potentially contact other colleagues. Ms. Garcia objects to the witness's\nLine 267, 16:07:15: interpretation of his supervisor's tone, leading Mr. Thompson to rephrase the question, to which Mr.\nLine 268, 16:07:15: Anderson reiterates feeling discouraged and unheard, fearing his concerns wouldn't be taken seriously\nLine 269, 16:07:15: and could hinder his career.\nLine 270, 16:07:15: Deposition\nLine 271, 16:07:15: Ms. Garcia: Mr. Thompson, I believe we've covered the essential topics for today. However, as these are\nLine 272, 16:07:15: complex claims, I would appreciate the opportunity to review the transcript and potentially ask further\nLine 273, 16:07:15: questions at a future session, should any need arise.\nLine 274, 16:07:15: Mr. Thompson: No objection. Mr. Anderson, as Ms. Garcia mentioned, we appreciate your willingness to\nLine 275, 16:07:15: cooperate and provide additional materials. We will be in touch to schedule a follow-up session if\nLine 276, 16:07:15: needed.\nLine 277, 16:07:15: Witness: Understood.\nLine 278, 16:07:15: Summary\nLine 279, 16:07:15: The deposition concludes with Ms. Garcia expressing a desire to review the transcript and potentially\nLine 280, 16:07:15: ask further questions in a future session if needed. Mr. Thompson agrees, and both thank Mr. Anderson\nLine 281, 16:07:15: for his cooperation and willingness to provide additional materials. Mr. Anderson acknowledges their\nLine 282, 16:07:15: communication and awaits further information regarding a potential follow-up session.\n--- End of Page 9 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 10 ---\nLine 283, 16:07:15: Deposition\nLine 284, 16:07:15: MILLER: A driver is obligated to pay attention to the road and yield to other drivers when required. Let\nLine 285, 16:07:15: me take you back to what happened on April 20th, 2022. The Defendant, who was an attorney for the\nLine 286, 16:07:15: IRS, was driving her usual route to work. She drove down Annapolis Road to take a left onto another\nLine 287, 16:07:15: road.\nLine 288, 16:07:15: (Could we have the next slide, please?) She was driving down this road\u2026 can everyone see this? She\nLine 289, 16:07:15: stopped at a light on a clear day. While stopped, she reached down to find her parking pass.\nLine 290, 16:07:15: DEFENSE LAWYER: May we approach?\nLine 291, 16:07:15: THE COURT: Yes.\nLine 292, 16:07:15: BENCH CONFERENCE\nLine 293, 16:07:15: (Bench Conference begins \u2013 10:26:39m.)\nLine 294, 16:07:15: (The parties approach the bench for a discussion.)\nLine 295, 16:07:15: THE COURT: By court ruling, liability has been established. The focus of this case is only on damages. I\nLine 296, 16:07:15: understand why we\u2019re discussing these details, but it\u2019s about damages.\nLine 297, 16:07:15: MILLER: I\u2019m setting the scene for the accident because her damages are part of the accident narrative.\nLine 298, 16:07:15: DEFENSE LAWYER: We\u2019re only discussing the fact that an accident happened and a person was injured.\nLine 299, 16:07:15: The details about reaching and negligence seem to be evidence of liability.\nLine 300, 16:07:15: THE COURT: I understand. It\u2019s your opening statement, so I\u2019ll give you some leeway.\nLine 301, 16:07:15: MILLER: I\u2019m just providing context. I\u2019ll be getting into the damages soon.\nLine 302, 16:07:15: THE COURT: Alright.\nLine 303, 16:07:15: (Bench Conference concluded \u2013 10:27:32 m.)\nLine 304, 16:07:15: (The parties return to their places.)\nLine 305, 16:07:15: MILLER: The Defendant heard a horn beep and took a left turn. She didn\u2019t see the Plaintiff, who had the\nLine 306, 16:07:15: right of way, coming from the opposite direction. Due to the collision, the Plaintiff\u2019s ankle was broken\nLine 307, 16:07:15: and required surgery.\nLine 308, 16:07:15: Take a look at these images. The first one shows her ankle before surgery, the second one after surgery.\nLine 309, 16:07:15: Today, she still has 15 screws and three plates in her ankle. She will never be able to run again and\nLine 310, 16:07:15: standing for extended periods of time is difficult.\nLine 311, 16:07:15: We\u2019ve brought this case before you because of the harm caused to the Plaintiff. We needed to agree\nLine 312, 16:07:15: that the Defendant was at fault for the accident, which she has accepted. We also had to understand the\nLine 313, 16:07:15: extent and implications of the Plaintiff\u2019s damages, not just the initial injury and surgery, but also its long-\nLine 314, 16:07:15: term impact on her life.\nLine 315, 16:07:15: To do this, we spoke to her doctors, her husband, her friends, and even her employer. One of her\nLine 316, 16:07:15: doctors is going to talk to you.\n--- End of Page 10 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 11 ---\nLine 317, 16:07:15: This is the guy to see if something awful like this is going to happen to your ankle. He received an Ivy\nLine 318, 16:07:15: League education and, at one point, was the chief of foot and ankle orthopedic injuries at Johns\nLine 319, 16:07:15: Hopkins. He consults for the Baltimore Orioles. His resume, I want to say, is as long as your arm, but it\u2019s\nLine 320, 16:07:15: actually a lot longer than that.\nLine 321, 16:07:15: We\u2019re going to bring him to talk to you guys, in a very 2023 way. It\u2019s going to be by videotape, so his\nLine 322, 16:07:15: testimony will be by videotape, but it holds the same force as if it was at trial, and he came here to see\nLine 323, 16:07:15: us. And, of course, my partner Laura Zois and the defense attorney had an opportunity to ask him\nLine 324, 16:07:15: questions.\nLine 325, 16:07:15: He\u2019s going to tell you she still has 15 screws and three plates in her ankle holding everything together.\nLine 326, 16:07:15: The problem with that is that it creates a breeding ground for arthritis, and this 33-year-old woman\nLine 327, 16:07:15: already has the signs of arthritis. At some point, she\u2019s going to need what\u2019s called a fusion, which will\nLine 328, 16:07:15: stabilize her ankle. The bad news is, you can\u2019t move it once it locks, so you no longer have the ability to\nLine 329, 16:07:15: bend.\nLine 330, 16:07:15: This trial is about the harms and losses that she has suffered and endured as the result of this accident.\nLine 331, 16:07:15: This is not a case about sympathy. You should not award her damages because you feel sorry for her.\nLine 332, 16:07:15: You\u2019re going to hear about how the accident has impacted her professional and personal life.\nLine 333, 16:07:15: At the time of the crash, they were a very young family. They were an energetic family. This is an active\nLine 334, 16:07:15: family with four kids doing everything you can imagine, Six Flags, the park. They would run together.\nLine 335, 16:07:15: They played basketball together. They traveled everywhere, New York, Baltimore, Washington, DC. They\nLine 336, 16:07:15: were just a very active family.\nLine 337, 16:07:15: And she also had a vibrant social life. She was a hairstylist, and she loved that job. It was her social outlet\nLine 338, 16:07:15: beside her kids. She would do the church choir every Wednesday, and still found times to go out and see\nLine 339, 16:07:15: her family. She\u2019s still fighting with her family, but it\u2019s hard.\nLine 340, 16:07:15: She can\u2019t work as a hairstylist anymore. So what did she do? She went back to school to the University\nLine 341, 16:07:15: of Maryland. She\u2019s working, getting very close to getting her degree. She\u2019s still fighting. She has four kids\nLine 342, 16:07:15: they\u2019re chasing around.\nLine 343, 16:07:15: Let\u2019s go back and talk about how it ended up. Let\u2019s talk about the accident. She had this awful crash and\nLine 344, 16:07:15: needed emergency surgery where they put in these screws. She had a nine-month-old baby, along with\nLine 345, 16:07:15: three other kids. She and the two girls, the younger ones, went to live with her mom. Her mom took\nLine 346, 16:07:15: care of her and the girls, while her husband took care of the other kids.\nLine 347, 16:07:15: This has been a massive disruption to their lives. The accident has completely changed her life, and it\u2019s\nLine 348, 16:07:15: reflected in every facet of her day-to-day. Her job, her family life, her hobbies, everything she used to\nLine 349, 16:07:15: take pleasure in has been impacted in one way or another. And the evidence in this case will show these\nLine 350, 16:07:15: changes are likely to persist for the rest of her life.\nLine 351, 16:07:15: We ask you to consider the totality of these changes, the persistent harm and loss she\u2019s suffered and\nLine 352, 16:07:15: will continue to suffer, as a direct result of the accident. We ask you to consider these when coming to a\nLine 353, 16:07:15: decision in this case.\n--- End of Page 11 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 12 ---\nLine 354, 16:07:15: This accident, however, led to an upheaval in their lives. About a month after the accident, she managed\nLine 355, 16:07:15: to return home with the kids. Her mother, an FDA employee, took three months off work to care for her,\nLine 356, 16:07:15: her daughter, and her grandchildren. The accident wreaked havoc on their lives.\nLine 357, 16:07:15: She endured six months of rigorous physical therapy and another operation. While it was painful and\nLine 358, 16:07:15: difficult, the effort was worthwhile as it improved her condition, especially her ankle, though we wish\nLine 359, 16:07:15: she had recovered more.\nLine 360, 16:07:15: As we delve into this case, it\u2019s about the harm and losses experienced. We will ask you to make amends\nLine 361, 16:07:15: where possible and provide compensation for the irreparable harm. The damages can be categorized\nLine 362, 16:07:15: into three parts: her medical bills, the post-accident trauma suffered by her and her family, and the pain\nLine 363, 16:07:15: she will endure for the expected next 45 years of her life.\nLine 364, 16:07:15: She was a spontaneous person, fond of making impromptu plans like going to Virginia Beach over the\nLine 365, 16:07:15: weekend or heading to the park. Now, every activity revolves around her ability to reach there, her\nLine 366, 16:07:15: mobility, and whether she can tolerate the pain during the trip. This situation has affected her and her\nLine 367, 16:07:15: four kids, as well as her husband.\nLine 368, 16:07:15: The court wants to clarify that the evidence and testimonies from the witness stand are what will\nLine 369, 16:07:15: control your deliberations. Opening statements and closing arguments of lawyers do not constitute\nLine 370, 16:07:15: evidence.\nLine 371, 16:07:15: This case is not just about the suffering of their children or her husband. It\u2019s about the impact of their\nLine 372, 16:07:15: suffering on her. We will ask you to consider an amount that may seem high at the beginning. But we\nLine 373, 16:07:15: believe that after hearing all the evidence, you\u2019ll find it to be a fair compensation for her losses and\nLine 374, 16:07:15: harm. The amount we suggest is $1.1 million.\nLine 375, 16:07:15: Defense Opening Statement\nLine 376, 16:07:15: Regarding the defendant, they acknowledge the responsibility for the accident and that it was their\nLine 377, 16:07:15: fault. The case is for you to determine the appropriate damages. The injury is severe, and they ask for an\nLine 378, 16:07:15: extraordinary amount of compensation.\nLine 379, 16:07:15: She broke her ankle, which was repaired surgically with plates and screws. There was a second surgery\nLine 380, 16:07:15: due to loosening of the screws, which were then removed. She attended physical therapy, which\nLine 381, 16:07:15: improved her ability to move her ankle. Whether she will need surgery in the future is uncertain.\nLine 382, 16:07:15: The past medical expenses are around $36,505, which we don\u2019t contest. Her lost wages due to the\nLine 383, 16:07:15: accident are around $3,400 to $3,500. These are not the focal points of this case. The main issue is the\nLine 384, 16:07:15: amount to be awarded for non-economic damages, for which we request something fair, reasonable,\nLine 385, 16:07:15: and sensible.\nLine 386, 16:07:15: Thank you for your time and attention, and we hope to conclude this case promptly.\nLine 387, 16:07:15: Testimony of Victim\u2019s Husband\nLine 388, 16:07:15: Mr. Miller: Good morning. Can I have your address?\nLine 389, 16:07:15: SJ: Certainly.\nLine 390, 16:07:15: Mr. Miller: How long have you lived at that address?\n--- End of Page 12 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 13 ---\nLine 391, 16:07:16: SJ: I bought the house in 2003, so it\u2019s been approximately ten years.\nLine 392, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Who lives there with you?\nLine 393, 16:07:16: SJ: My wife, and our four children.\nLine 394, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Can you tell the jury how old your children are and their names?\nLine 395, 16:07:16: SJ: Yes. My children are 13, and the others are\u2026\nLine 396, 16:07:16: The Honorable Judge: Please continue.\nLine 397, 16:07:16: SJ: \u2026five, and three.\nLine 398, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: I understand. And for some background, what do you do for a living?\nLine 399, 16:07:16: SJ: I\u2019m currently the general manager at Oreck Clean Home Center.\nLine 400, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: And where are these locations?\nLine 401, 16:07:16: SJ: We have six locations in Maryland and Virginia.\nLine 402, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: What are your responsibilities at work?\nLine 403, 16:07:16: SJ: I oversee all six stores and manage one of them.\nLine 404, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Can you describe your work schedule?\nLine 405, 16:07:16: SJ: I work Monday through Saturday, from 10:00 am to 7:00 pm. Often, I work seven days a week which\nLine 406, 16:07:16: means working on Sundays from 12:00 pm to 5:00 pm.\nLine 407, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: How do you feel about those hours?\nLine 408, 16:07:16: SJ: They are long, but I need to work to support my family.\nLine 409, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: How long have you known your wife?\nLine 410, 16:07:16: SJ: I met her in 1993, she was my sister\u2019s best friend.\nLine 411, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: You mean your wife was your sister\u2019s best friend?\nLine 412, 16:07:16: SJ: Yes, I apologize for the confusion. She was indeed my sister\u2019s best friend.\nLine 413, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Let\u2019s move to another topic. Do you remember the car accident your wife was in 2022?\nLine 414, 16:07:16: SJ: Yes, I do.\nLine 415, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Prior to the accident, can you describe your household?\nLine 416, 16:07:16: SJ: Our household was what I would consider the perfect life. My wife and children were happy and\nLine 417, 16:07:16: always engaged in activities. We used to take vacations and attend family reunions.\nLine 418, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Was your wife a spontaneous person or a planner?\nLine 419, 16:07:16: SJ: She was more spontaneous, always ready to take on new activities.\n--- End of Page 13 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 14 ---\nLine 420, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Could you describe her for the jury?\nLine 421, 16:07:16: SJ: She is always happy, loves socializing and helping people. She attended choir rehearsal, Bible study\nLine 422, 16:07:16: every week, and also took care of our four children.\nLine 423, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: What was her job at the time of the crash?\nLine 424, 16:07:16: SJ: She was the assistant manager of a hair salon.\nLine 425, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Did she enjoy her work?\nLine 426, 16:07:16: SJ: Yes, she loved her work. It was part of her identity.\nLine 427, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Did your wife\u2019s demeanor change after the car accident?\nLine 428, 16:07:16: SJ: Yes, after the accident everything changed. Our family life and activity level changed significantly. She\nLine 429, 16:07:16: used to take the children to sporting events and practice basketball. Now, she can\u2019t do these activities.\nLine 430, 16:07:16: She no longer goes on family vacations. My two older sons call her \u201cboring\u201d now because of her reduced\nLine 431, 16:07:16: activity level. The accident has restricted her capabilities and as a result, she can\u2019t even do simple tasks\nLine 432, 16:07:16: like carrying laundry baskets or standing up to cook. Our family life has changed drastically since the\nLine 433, 16:07:16: accident.\nLine 434, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Has your wife gone back to work since the accident?\nLine 435, 16:07:16: SJ: She tried to help a friend out a couple of months ago at her hair salon, but it ended with her in a lot\nLine 436, 16:07:16: of pain due to the swelling in her ankle.\nLine 437, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: I have here a picture you received from your wife. Is this the picture she sent you?\nLine 438, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Can you tell us how your wife\u2019s personal social life has been affected since the crash?\nLine 439, 16:07:16: SJ: Her social life has indeed changed significantly. Before the accident, she would regularly go out with\nLine 440, 16:07:16: friends, engage in dancing, and other social activities. However, the constant pain and discomfort after\nLine 441, 16:07:16: the crash have made such activities impossible. Her social life is definitely not the same as before.\nLine 442, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: You mentioned earlier about her job. Was she able to resume work post the crash?\nLine 443, 16:07:16: SJ: She attempted to return to work, but the persistent pain made it unmanageable, particularly the\nLine 444, 16:07:16: long-standing hours. Eventually, she was forced to leave her job.\nLine 445, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: How has this situation impacted your family\u2019s finances?\nLine 446, 16:07:16: SJ: The impact has been substantial. She held the position of an assistant manager at a hair salon,\nLine 447, 16:07:16: bringing in a significant income. Now, with my single income, managing expenses for our four children\nLine 448, 16:07:16: and her medical bills has been strenuous.\nLine 449, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Besides the financial struggle, can you share how your relationship with your wife has\nLine 450, 16:07:16: evolved post the accident?\nLine 451, 16:07:16: SJ: Our relationship has undeniably been affected. She isn\u2019t the same person she was before the crash.\nLine 452, 16:07:16: Her constant pain and fatigue, coupled with frustration, have been hard on both of us.\nLine 453, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: And your children? How have they been coping with all these changes?\n--- End of Page 14 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 15 ---\nLine 454, 16:07:16: SJ: Our children have had to make significant adjustments. They miss the mother they had before the\nLine 455, 16:07:16: crash, not understanding why she can\u2019t engage in the activities she used to do with them. My older\nLine 456, 16:07:16: sons, in particular, have had to step up, assisting more with household chores. It\u2019s been a lot for them\nLine 457, 16:07:16: too.\nLine 458, 16:07:16: Mr. Miller: Finally, could you share your hopes for your wife\u2019s future?\nLine 459, 16:07:16: SJ: My biggest hope is for her to find relief from her pain and regain some semblance of normalcy. She\nLine 460, 16:07:16: deserves to live her life, not just endure it. It\u2019s challenging to see such a wonderful person go through\nLine 461, 16:07:16: this. We are taking each day as it comes, hoping for a better future.\nLine 462, 16:07:16: Defense Attorney Cross Examination of Victim\u2019s Husband\nLine 463, 16:07:16: Q: Regarding the foot stretching exercises, you assist her with those?\nLine 464, 16:07:16: A: Yes, I do.\nLine 465, 16:07:16: Q: Looking through her medical records, I noticed there\u2019s mention of an exercise bike at home.

About how often do you get pain?\nLine 1634, 16:03:43: A. It depends on activity. I would say probably\nLine 1635, 16:03:43: about four or five times a week. It depends how long\nLine 1636, 16:03:43: I'm on it.\nLine 1637, 16:03:43: Q. Okay. What type of activity causes the pain?\nLine 1638, 16:03:43: A. Well, just being on it all day or walking.\nLine 1639, 16:03:43: Like if I go to the mall or something, a couple hours\nLine 1640, 16:03:43: of driving a stick shift vehicle.\nLine 1641, 16:03:43: Q. Do you have a stick shift vehicle?\nLine 1642, 16:03:43: A. Not anymore. My wife's -- my girlfriend's\nLine 1643, 16:03:43: brother, he has a stick shift vehicie.

What I do when I'm shoveling now is\nLine 1667, 16:03:43: of using my right leg -- you know, when you\nLine 1668, 16:03:43: you've got to kick the shovel in to be able\nLine 1669, 16:03:43: the dirt out,\nLine 1670, 16:03:43: Q. This is when you're digging like contaminated\nLine 1671, 16:03:43: soil or something like that?\nLine 1672, 16:03:43: A. Yeah. So what I do is kick with my left\nLine 1673, 16:03:43: instead of kicking with my right.\nLine 1674, 16:03:43: Q. So you rest on the right and you do the work\nLine 1675, 16:03:43: with the left?\nLine 1676, 16:03:43: Corbin & Hook Reporting, Inc.\nLine 1677, 16:03:43: (410) 268-6006 - 1-866-337-6778\n--- End of Page 66 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 67 ---\nLine 1678, 16:03:43: Deposition of Sain\nLine 1679, 16:03:43: Taken on July 28, 2004\nLine 1680, 16:03:43: Page 67\nLine 1681, 16:03:43: A.

Sometimes in the morning I'll wake\nLine 1708, 16:03:43: up and I'll have that pain, so I know I have to carry\nLine 1709, 16:03:43: it with me.\nLine 1710, 16:03:43: Q. Is there anything that your knee condition\nLine 1711, 16:03:43: prevents you from doing today that you could do back\nLine 1712, 16:03:43: before February of 2003?\nLine 1713, 16:03:43: A. Well, I was running around riding a bike and\nLine 1714, 16:03:43: stuff. I'm not doing that anymore. I might jump on\nLine 1715, 16:03:43: a motorcycle every now and then, but I'm not pedaling\nLine 1716, 16:03:43: a bike or anything anymore.\nLine 1717, 16:03:43: Q.

Not that I can't do it, just I don't want to\nLine 1742, 16:03:47: do anything that might aggravate my knee. I probably\nLine 1743, 16:03:47: can, but I don't want to do it because it's just the\nLine 1744, 16:03:47: fear of getting hurt again I guess.\nLine 1745, 16:03:47: Q. And when did you start riding a bike after\nLine 1746, 16:03:47: your prior surgery in, say -- which was I guess\nLine 1747, 16:03:47: November of 2000?\nLine 1748, 16:03:47: A.

Basically what the\nLine 1589, 16:03:39: doctor said, that they were going to do the therapy\nLine 1590, 16:03:39: to strengthen the knee for surgery. This way I'd\nLine 1591, 16:03:39: have supposedly a quicker recovery.\nLine 1592, 16:03:39: Q.

They did\nLine 1615, 16:03:39: therapy, then like a month later after the scarring\nLine 1616, 16:03:39: healed they put me in aquatic therapy.\nLine 1617, 16:03:39: Q. When you say scarring, you mean the scabs\nLine 1618, 16:03:39: from the surgery?\nLine 1619, 16:03:39: A. Yeah. After all that healed up, they put me\nLine 1620, 16:03:39: in aquatic therapy which is the pool.\nLine 1621, 16:03:39: Q. Right.\nLine 1622, 16:03:39: A.

About how often do you get pain?\nLine 1634, 16:03:43: A. It depends on activity. I would say probably\nLine 1635, 16:03:43: about four or five times a week. It depends how long\nLine 1636, 16:03:43: I'm on it.\nLine 1637, 16:03:43: Q. Okay. What type of activity causes the pain?\nLine 1638, 16:03:43: A. Well, just being on it all day or walking.\nLine 1639, 16:03:43: Like if I go to the mall or something, a couple hours\nLine 1640, 16:03:43: of driving a stick shift vehicle.\nLine 1641, 16:03:43: Q. Do you have a stick shift vehicle?\nLine 1642, 16:03:43: A. Not anymore. My wife's -- my girlfriend's\nLine 1643, 16:03:43: brother, he has a stick shift vehicie.

What I do when I'm shoveling now is\nLine 1667, 16:03:43: of using my right leg -- you know, when you\nLine 1668, 16:03:43: you've got to kick the shovel in to be able\nLine 1669, 16:03:43: the dirt out,\nLine 1670, 16:03:43: Q. This is when you're digging like contaminated\nLine 1671, 16:03:43: soil or something like that?\nLine 1672, 16:03:43: A. Yeah. So what I do is kick with my left\nLine 1673, 16:03:43: instead of kicking with my right.\nLine 1674, 16:03:43: Q. So you rest on the right and you do the work\nLine 1675, 16:03:43: with the left?\nLine 1676, 16:03:43: Corbin & Hook Reporting, Inc.\nLine 1677, 16:03:43: (410) 268-6006 - 1-866-337-6778\n--- End of Page 66 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 67 ---\nLine 1678, 16:03:43: Deposition of Sain\nLine 1679, 16:03:43: Taken on July 28, 2004\nLine 1680, 16:03:43: Page 67\nLine 1681, 16:03:43: A.

Well, I was running around riding a bike and\nLine 1714, 16:03:43: stuff. I'm not doing that anymore.

Not that I can't do it, just I don't want to\nLine 1742, 16:03:47: do anything that might aggravate my knee. I probably\nLine 1743, 16:03:47: can, but I don't want to do it because it's just the\nLine 1744, 16:03:47: fear of getting hurt again I guess.\nLine 1745, 16:03:47: Q.

Anything else that you do\nLine 1657, 16:03:43: specifically that causes pain?\nLine 1658, 16:03:43: A. I can't think of anything right now.\nLine 1659, 16:03:43: Q. Okay.

When you're doing shoveling, does that cause\nLine 1664, 16:03:43: problems with your knee either while you're working\nLine 1665, 16:03:43: or later?\nLine 1666, 16:03:43: A. What I do when I'm shoveling now is\nLine 1667, 16:03:43: of using my right leg -- you know, when you\nLine 1668, 16:03:43: you've got to kick the shovel in to be able\nLine 1669, 16:03:43: the dirt out,\nLine 1670, 16:03:43: Q. This is when you're digging like contaminated\nLine 1671, 16:03:43: soil or something like that?\nLine 1672, 16:03:43: A. Yeah. So what I do is kick with my left\nLine 1673, 16:03:43: instead of kicking with my right.\nLine 1674, 16:03:43: Q. So you rest on the right and you do the work\nLine 1675, 16:03:43: with the left?\nLine 1676, 16:03:43: Corbin & Hook Reporting, Inc.\nLine 1677, 16:03:43: (410) 268-6006 - 1-866-337-6778\n--- End of Page 66 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 67 ---\nLine 1678, 16:03:43: Deposition of Sain\nLine 1679, 16:03:43: Taken on July 28, 2004\nLine 1680, 16:03:43: Page 67\nLine 1681, 16:03:43: A.

Probably out of a month probably\nLine 1685, 16:03:43: twice.\nLine 1686, 16:03:43: Q. Okay. Obviously that's only on land spiils\nLine 1687, 16:03:43: or something like that?\nLine 1688, 16:03:43: A. Yeah. We don't have many water spills\nLine 1689, 16:03:43: either.\nLine 1690, 16:03:43: Q. Right.

Yeah.\nLine 1694, 16:03:43: What do you do for the pain?\nLine 1695, 16:03:43: Aspercreme or Flexall.\nLine 1696, 16:03:43: And those are both over the counter, right?\nLine 1697, 16:03:43: A.

Sometimes in the morning I'll wake\nLine 1708, 16:03:43: up and I'll have that pain, so I know I have to carry\nLine 1709, 16:03:43: it with me.\nLine 1710, 16:03:43: Q. Is there anything that your knee condition\nLine 1711, 16:03:43: prevents you from doing today that you could do back\nLine 1712, 16:03:43: before February of 2003?\nLine 1713, 16:03:43: A. Well, I was running around riding a bike and\nLine 1714, 16:03:43: stuff. I'm not doing that anymore. I might jump on\nLine 1715, 16:03:43: a motorcycle every now and then, but I'm not pedaling\nLine 1716, 16:03:43: a bike or anything anymore.\nLine 1717, 16:03:43: Q.

I went out whenever my stepson wanted to go\nLine 1720, 16:03:43: out probably about once a week.\nLine 1721, 16:03:43: Q. Did you have your own bike?\nLine 1722, 16:03:43: A. Yeah.\nLine 1723, 16:03:43: Do you still have it?\nLine 1724, 16:03:43: No.\nLine 1725, 16:03:43: Q. And when would you ride with him?\nLine 1726, 16:03:43: A.

Not that I can't do it, just I don't want to\nLine 1742, 16:03:47: do anything that might aggravate my knee. I probably\nLine 1743, 16:03:47: can, but I don't want to do it because it's just the\nLine 1744, 16:03:47: fear of getting hurt again I guess.\nLine 1745, 16:03:47: Q. And when did you start riding a bike after\nLine 1746, 16:03:47: your prior surgery in, say -- which was I guess\nLine 1747, 16:03:47: November of 2000?\nLine 1748, 16:03:47: A.

He put me in the therapy program.\nLine 1556, 16:03:39: Q.\nLine 1557, 16:03:39: Was this for your knee?\nLine 1558, 16:03:39: A. Yeah.\nLine 1559, 16:03:39: 11 Q. Any other parts of your body?\nLine 1560, 16:03:39: 12 A.

Did the low back pain resolve within a couple\nLine 1564, 16:03:39: weeks or a month?\nLine 1565, 16:03:39: 17 A. Yeah.\nLine 1566, 16:03:39: 18 | Q. Any,other parts of youg body other than the\nLine 1567, 16:03:39: knee that were continuing to give you problems more\nLine 1568, 16:03:39: than a month after the accident?\nLine 1569, 16:03:39: A. No.\nLine 1570, 16:03:39: Corbin & Hook Reporting, Inc.\nLine 1571, 16:03:39: (410) 268-6006 - 1-866-337-6778\n--- End of Page 62 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 63 ---\nLine 1572, 16:03:39: Deposition of\nLine 1573, 16:03:39: Taken on July 28, 2004\nLine 1574, 16:03:39: Page 63\nLine 1575, 16:03:39: 1 Q.

I think the surgery was in May of 2003, does\nLine 1584, 16:03:39: that sound right?\nLine 1585, 16:03:39: 10 A. I think so,\nLine 1586, 16:03:39: 11 Q. The knee, was it improved at all with the\nLine 1587, 16:03:39: therapy or did the therapy just not help?\nLine 1588, 16:03:39: 13 A. No, it wasn't doing much. Basically what the\nLine 1589, 16:03:39: doctor said, that they were going to do the therapy\nLine 1590, 16:03:39: to strengthen the knee for surgery. This way I'd\nLine 1591, 16:03:39: have supposedly a quicker recovery.\nLine 1592, 16:03:39: Q.

But it was Dr. Shepherd who actually\nLine 1607, 16:03:39: sent you to Dr. O'Hearn?\nLine 1608, 16:03:39: A. Yeah.\nLine 1609, 16:03:39: Q. You hadn't treated with Dr. O'Hearn for\nLine 1610, 16:03:39: anything else before this?\nLine 1611, 16:03:39: A. No.\nLine 1612, 16:03:39: Q. Okay. They did the surgery in May of 2003.\nLine 1613, 16:03:39: Tell me about your recovery after that surgery.\nLine 1614, 16:03:39: A. I went back to the therapy center. They did\nLine 1615, 16:03:39: therapy, then like a month later after the scarring\nLine 1616, 16:03:39: healed they put me in aquatic therapy.\nLine 1617, 16:03:39: Q. When you say scarring, you mean the scabs\nLine 1618, 16:03:39: from the surgery?\nLine 1619, 16:03:39: A. Yeah. After all that healed up, they put me\nLine 1620, 16:03:39: in aquatic therapy which is the pool.\nLine 1621, 16:03:39: Q. Right.\nLine 1622, 16:03:39: A.

About how often do you get pain?\nLine 1634, 16:03:43: A. It depends on activity. I would say probably\nLine 1635, 16:03:43: about four or five times a week. It depends how long\nLine 1636, 16:03:43: I'm on it.\nLine 1637, 16:03:43: Q. Okay. What type of activity causes the pain?\nLine 1638, 16:03:43: A. Well, just being on it all day or walking.\nLine 1639, 16:03:43: Like if I go to the mall or something, a couple hours\nLine 1640, 16:03:43: of driving a stick shift vehicle.\nLine 1641, 16:03:43: Q. Do you have a stick shift vehicle?\nLine 1642, 16:03:43: A. Not anymore. My wife's -- my girlfriend's\nLine 1643, 16:03:43: brother, he has a stick shift vehicie.

Anything else that you do\nLine 1657, 16:03:43: specifically that causes pain?\nLine 1658, 16:03:43: A. I can't think of anything right now.\nLine 1659, 16:03:43: Q. Okay.

When you're doing shoveling, does that cause\nLine 1664, 16:03:43: problems with your knee either while you're working\nLine 1665, 16:03:43: or later?\nLine 1666, 16:03:43: A. What I do when I'm shoveling now is\nLine 1667, 16:03:43: of using my right leg -- you know, when you\nLine 1668, 16:03:43: you've got to kick the shovel in to be able\nLine 1669, 16:03:43: the dirt out,\nLine 1670, 16:03:43: Q. This is when you're digging like contaminated\nLine 1671, 16:03:43: soil or something like that?\nLine 1672, 16:03:43: A. Yeah. So what I do is kick with my left\nLine 1673, 16:03:43: instead of kicking with my right.\nLine 1674, 16:03:43: Q. So you rest on the right and you do the work\nLine 1675, 16:03:43: with the left?\nLine 1676, 16:03:43: Corbin & Hook Reporting, Inc.\nLine 1677, 16:03:43: (410) 268-6006 - 1-866-337-6778\n--- End of Page 66 ---\n\n--- Beginning of Page 67 ---\nLine 1678, 16:03:43: Deposition of Sain\nLine 1679, 16:03:43: Taken on July 28, 2004\nLine 1680, 16:03:43: Page 67\nLine 1681, 16:03:43: A.

Obviously that's only on land spiils\nLine 1687, 16:03:43: or something like that?\nLine 1688, 16:03:43: A. Yeah. We don't have many water spills\nLine 1689, 16:03:43: either.\nLine 1690, 16:03:43: Q. Right. So you indicated your knee feels okay\nLine 1691, 16:03:43: stability wise, but you get pain four or five times a\nLine 1692, 16:03:43: week?\nLine 1693, 16:03:43: A. Yeah.\nLine 1694, 16:03:43: What do you do for the pain?\nLine 1695, 16:03:43: Aspercreme or Flexall.\nLine 1696, 16:03:43: And those are both over the counter, right?\nLine 1697, 16:03:43: A.

Sometimes in the morning I'll wake\nLine 1708, 16:03:43: up and I'll have that pain, so I know I have to carry\nLine 1709, 16:03:43: it with me.\nLine 1710, 16:03:43: Q. Is there anything that your knee condition\nLine 1711, 16:03:43: prevents you from doing today that you could do back\nLine 1712, 16:03:43: before February of 2003?\nLine 1713, 16:03:43: A. Well, I was running around riding a bike and\nLine 1714, 16:03:43: stuff. I'm not doing that anymore. I might jump on\nLine 1715, 16:03:43: a motorcycle every now and then, but I'm not pedaling\nLine 1716, 16:03:43: a bike or anything anymore.\nLine 1717, 16:03:43: Q.

Not that I can't do it, just I don't want to\nLine 1742, 16:03:47: do anything that might aggravate my knee. I probably\nLine 1743, 16:03:47: can, but I don't want to do it because it's just the\nLine 1744, 16:03:47: fear of getting hurt again I guess.\nLine 1745, 16:03:47: Q. And when did you start riding a bike after\nLine 1746, 16:03:47: your prior surgery in, say -- which was I guess\nLine 1747, 16:03:47: November of 2000?\nLine 1748, 16:03:47: A.

So the two of you were going\nLine 597, 16:04:41: alongside of each other on North Point for a period\nLine 598, 16:04:41: of time at about the same speed, and did you ever\nLine 599, 16:04:41: see a turn signal on the truck?\nLine 600, 16:04:41: A. No, sir, I did not.\nLine 601, 16:04:41: Q. Can you describe to me the angle of the\nLine 602, 16:04:41: tractor when it hit you?

And what's the purpose of that?\nLine 976, 16:05:03: A. It deadens the nerves, because what\nLine 977, 16:05:03: happens is when you have severe nerve damage, it's\nLine 978, 16:05:03: like electrical impulses going off. It's like\nLine 979, 16:05:03: taking a cord and fraying it and all the electrical ;\nLine 980, 16:05:03: impulses going all over the place. That's what\nLine 981, 16:05:03: causes the pain in the tissues, so what they do is :\nLine 982, 16:05:03: they block it off so it doesn't go down that far.\nLine 983, 16:05:03: It just leaves an even line. |\nLine 984, 16:05:03: Q.

There was some damage done\nLine 592, 16:04:41: to the motor of the car, I think, because I had to\nLine 593, 16:04:41: take it back to Thompson Dodge because it was doing\nLine 594, 16:04:41: so much rattling, and they had to do something to\nLine 595, 16:04:41: the steering.\nLine 596, 16:04:41: Q.

There was some damage done\nLine 592, 16:06:43: to the motor of the car, I think, because I had to\nLine 593, 16:06:43: take it back to Thompson Dodge because it was doing\nLine 594, 16:06:43: so much rattling, and they had to do something to\nLine 595, 16:06:43: the steering.\nLine 596, 16:06:43: Q. Okay. So the two of you were going\nLine 597, 16:06:43: alongside of each other on North Point for a period\nLine 598, 16:06:43: of time at about the same speed, and did you ever\nLine 599, 16:06:43: see a turn signal on the truck?\nLine 600, 16:06:43: A.

The front of the truck would\nLine 619, 16:06:43: have pulled away from my truck instead of being so\nLine 620, 16:06:43: close to my truck.\nLine 621, 16:06:43: (Exhibit 4 marked.)\nLine 622, 16:06:43: BY MR.

Yes, it does, because his whole trailer\nLine 639, 16:06:46: was in his lane, and that lane, it was not over in\nLine 640, 16:06:46: any of the lanes.\nLine 641, 16:06:46: Q. Okay.

So in other words, trying to perceive what\nLine 645, 16:06:46: happened, it wasn't like the truck was sort of\nLine 646, 16:06:46: sliding over to the right?\nLine 647, 16:06:46: A.

I mean, I was holding onto\nLine 667, 16:06:46: the steering wheel, and I don't know what happened.\nLine 668, 16:06:46: I mean, it just, the impact, because I mean, he just\nLine 669, 16:06:46: came in over my, just came in front of me, and it\nLine 670, 16:06:46: was like boom.

And what's the purpose of that?\nLine 976, 16:06:58: A. It deadens the nerves, because what\nLine 977, 16:06:58: happens is when you have severe nerve damage, it's\nLine 978, 16:06:58: like electrical impulses going off. It's like\nLine 979, 16:06:58: taking a cord and fraying it and all the electrical ;\nLine 980, 16:06:58: impulses going all over the place. That's what\nLine 981, 16:06:58: causes the pain in the tissues, so what they do is :\nLine 982, 16:06:58: they block it off so it doesn't go down that far.\nLine 983, 16:06:58: It just leaves an even line. |\nLine 984, 16:06:58: Q.

TI had to be back, I was back at |\nLine 1209, 16:07:10: work the following week after the surgery because\nLine 1210, 16:07:10: like I said, I have no long-term disability. I\nLine 1211, 16:07:10: exhausted all my, my time. I've been there 11\nLine 1212, 16:07:10: years, and I get three weeks vacation.
